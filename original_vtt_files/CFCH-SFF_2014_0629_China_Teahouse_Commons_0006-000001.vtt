<i>Speaker 1</i>: [[background noise]] Please keep your conversations going don't let me interrupt my name is James [[??]] I work at The Center For Folklife and Cultural Heritage, where I serve as director of cultural heritage policy. In a minute I am going to be joined by Mrs [[??]] who is going to correct me in, she said that was great. I was about to say she was going to correct me in the massacring of her name. She is one of my colleagues here at the Smithsonian Institution at the National Museum of African Art which is just across the way. And by Mr. [[??]] Wong. Would you please welcome Mr. Wong. [[clapping]] Yes please.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And we are going to be talking about diasporas. I was just thinking that when I began um working at the Smithsonian Institution almost 40 years ago as a 26 year old graduate student at Howard University I was invited down to a meeting about the African diaspora. And here I was this young man, this African American I put that in quotations, invited to the very prestigious Smithsonian Institution. The mandate of mandate of which is the increase in the diffusion of knowledge in all of these scholars and they said "we want you to work with us on the African Diaspora program so I sat up and tried to look very intelligent. I knew that the word diaspora meant dispersion but I did not know how to connect it in any real way, because at that time people talked about the Jewish diaspora but it was not yet a term where everybody was talking about the spread of their cultures around the world and the very deep formal intimate way in which Jewish communities who had been dispersed around the world.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Now we have diaspora studies and diaspora scholars and diaspora department and if you put the word diaspora in your google it just pops up everywhere. Well we are going to talk about diaspora and identity. Miss [[??]] works again as community outreach coordinator at the National Museum of African Art and she is originally from Kenya but I want to put that in quotation because we are going to find out is she from Kenya, is she still there, is she here, how does that spread out? Is that a place over there and she's here? Are we living a new kind of sense of identity and reality?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:03:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And Mr. Raymond Wong who started his group Wong people in 1985 in Chinatown D.C. uh which is one of the hallmarks of inner city culture here in Washington D.C., less than a mile, a nice little walk right up 13th, uh 7th av, uh 7th street here. He is originally from [[??]] Hong Kong I hope I pronounced that appropriate. He came to the United States at one years of age with his mother and his group performs dragon and lion dances at special events and gives free classes in Kung fu and Tai chi to everyone from the homeless to kids to adults to senior citizens.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Mr. Wong believes that martial arts teach individuals how the body works, personal strengths and limits, self defense skills and how to use and understand your surroundings. Welcome. Lets start with Miss [[??]] to tell us who you are. Where you were born, what's your relationship is to where you where born and where you are.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:48.944 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Alright. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you so much for having me here. It is great to be here this afternoon. So I am born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. I came here as an adult to attend a university and I ended up living in Pennsylvania, which is where I went to school and um ended up, I'm trying to , ended up eventually staying and living and working in the U.S. and the question was which, where I place my identity and it's very interesting because I am Kenyan, by you know, my formative years in Nairobi, going to school, going to High School, primary school, working and living in Nairobi and then leaving as an adult to come out for higher education. And, you do

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: You do become part of the new country that you live in and you embrace it and you become apart of that as well.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, so, I see myself as African American. I am Kenyan and I am American. In many respects I am, I have both cultures in me.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, and so, you know I feel in some ways I'm very very Kenyan and in some ways you don't know if that ever goes away because it was from-

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
as your formative years so it is a part of just who you are. Um, and then you know as an adult you embrace your new environment, your new culture, and I am when I go home I am very American.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You know to my family and friends who are at home and so you have a duality but at the end I have myself Gathoni who I am as an individual

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and that is the same regardless of you know, which culture I'm living in and working in. I do live and work here in the U.S and so this is my home.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, and I also think of Nairobi as home. So I have two homes.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: As we, speak with Ms. Kamau and Mr. Wong I want you to be thinking about your identities. Um, what is your diaspora? Um, how do you describe yourself?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, and I do wanna come back to Ms. Kamau in just a moment on being African American but lets go to Mr. Wong.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Mr. Wong tell us when you came here you came with your mother did you have other family here already?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Okay well Uh, my father, he was actually born in Norfolk, Virginia Uh you know but traditional family, Chinese family, his dad sent him back to China to get a wife.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So you see the connection there?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Back to the dia- 
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Yes

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Back to the diasporas

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Back to China to get a wife, so he, I guess he got one, he hooked up and uh, a year later I was born,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but, uh, back then China did not have open relations with the U.S and people weren't able to leave, and uh, and move about freely as they can now

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and they really didn't have tourists that wasn't allowed back then. Uh, that was the 19- early 1960s uh 19- late 1950s.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, my mother escaped to Hong Kong as most Chinese and because back then Hong Kong was not under Chinese rules it was under British rule. So I was born in Hong Kong and uh, I guess I'm British.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[laughter]]

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yeah. Yeah I didn't think about that. Yeah so I was born in Hong Kong. So, about almost a year later, um, because my father was an American citizen

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, his grandfather was a well todo Chinese restaurant owner here in Norfolk, Virginia and he was one of the first to open up a Chinese restaurant in Norfolk because

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
back then there weren't that many Chinese uh, around period. So uh, he got a good lawyer and uh, filed the papers, and got, my mom and us both over to the U.S.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I got here about one and a half and have been here ever since. And uh, I guess I regard myself as an American citizen because uh educational wise, financial wise, credit card wise, I have U.S,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yeah, I'm U.S.A. But as far as my Chinese heritage, I try to maintain some of the teachings uh, some of the roots, and some of the practices, that make Chinese people Chinese.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So uh, what makes you who you are is not necessarily what government or what country you represent is the way you live and your lifestyle and the background of your family.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I try to maintain and live that as an American citizen of course.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: I can't think of a scholar who could have put it in a better theoretical or conceptual way. Culture travels with you no matter what your passport says.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
How does that come up in your being Kenyan? What are some of the cultural things that even as you describe yourself as an African American,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
are not historically associated with the evolved historical expressions and ways of knowing and doing of African Americans who came here in the first instance as descendants of of enslaved Africans?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: Ok so, I consider myself an African American, a Kenyan American. I'm not historically, you know, African American in the context that you just described

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but as sharing, you know, part of the culture just the way I live here in America Um, I, it's the little things like my colleague here was speaking about the food that I eat is very Kenyan

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you know, or even though, you know, I've lived here so many years there's some things that you say "I just didn't get it. What was the joke?" You know? You just don't get some things but um,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I think in that context you almost have to know more of the history or the context in which certain sayings or phrases come from.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, and so in that regard you know when I'm in Kenya also I'm like "What's that?" It's something new I don't know just because I live here

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:55.162 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but um, in terms of being, you know, like your culture is very dominant in us I believe as individuals and so-

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: It is part of who I am, in my language, in my speech, in the food that I prepare, in dances, listening to music.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You kind of end up incorporating everything that you have and looking at the diaspora, the dispersion, it's all over the world.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's almost like we are becoming this one global village, but you have your individual identities, we each have them but the culture that is dominant within us is the one

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we just immerse and thrive. You know America is special and unique in that it has every culture represented here so,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I am looking for a looking for a certain spice I will find it somewhere, you know I will find it here and so, you know I am at home, equally at home as I am in Nairobi.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: I think for many African Americans or black Americans of my generation, I'm just shy of 68 years of age,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it's a difficult thing I think and even for most of you, we tend to think about our identity based on what we know about our parents,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we perhaps knew about our grandparents if we were lucky, what we knew about our great grandparents,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and then we tend to place our identity in our actuarial chart of the hopefully 80 or so years that we are going to live.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But, check this out. Since the 1965 immigration act, more Africans have come to this country than were brought during the entire period of slavery.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
There were only approximately a half million enslaved Africans who were brought to the United States. We look alike but fifty, a hundred year from now,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
two hundred years from now, a short time in history, the culture, the ways of knowing and doing, because culture is alive, it continues to evolve and so this notion of African American has been stretched.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Mr. Wong when did you come to Washington, this predominatingly black city, I think still is about fifty one or so percent black, seventy percent black when I came here about forty years ago?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: I arrived around 1958-59, well 58 yeah. I'm not sure if I can remember what it looks like back then but it wasn't that black back then it was some,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
a lot of Jewish here back then along with the black population. Right after the Martin Luther King riots it became all black.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: You started working, when you started working in the community talk to us about who you were working with and what were some of the cultural issues that you encountered.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well my father, he opened up a Chinese restaurant because back then either you had  Chinese hand laundry or a Chinese restaurant.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, he managed to get into the restaurant business in the corner of second and Florida avenue northwest and that was black community. So everything was catered to the black community.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It was an American restaurant but it had Chinese food. The place was called Jimmy's, Jimmy's a good American name.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, he sold not only Chinese food but soul food, yeah southern food and we were there, he was there what, 1958 uh

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I think I closed it down, I didn't close it down but I discontinued the food service around 1980, 1995.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Alright, I just moved on to other things. But, we served the black community for three or four decades. Yes

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: What kind of influence did it have on the way that you look at life, your taste, your interests, your sense of self identity in this mix of  Chinese and African Americans?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.321 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well it just taught me some lessons that

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: All people have the same strengths, all people have the same weaknesses, all people experience all things,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you just have to get to know them. And the way you get to know them is you have to deal with them on a daily basis.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So if me, having to work there, uh, I have to deal with the customers on a daily basis. Uh, I dealt with some really nice people, and I dealt with some really bad people.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I dealt with, uh, educated people, I dealt with drug addicts.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I, even had a gun stuck to my face a few times, for hold-ups several times,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and, uh, I made it through that, and, uh, but, uh, you know, you have to get to know the people, whoever they are.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And once we get to know them, then you understand.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Have you had the experience of new Chinese immigrants coming who became Chinese citizens, Chinese American citizens?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
What has been your sense of your identity in relationship to them, are their sense of their identity

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
in relationship to the kinds of history and experience that you come out of?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well the Chinese who are coming over now, uh, they come over for opportunity. They come over to start a business, and uh, that's good but

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
when you move into community and you start a business, is not just about selling something

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
or providing a service? It's also about getting to know the people.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Because if you get to know the people, then your business transactions will be a lot smoother than if you did not know the people,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because, uh, it's that personal element that's missing that keeps business flowing smoothly.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, the--as far as the newer Chinese, the language barrier, that kind of keeps them from interacting with the customers

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so they just keep it at "Okay. You want this? Give me this, uh, it's five dollars." You know?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and they just kind of leave it at that,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and a lot of times that causes friction in the community, because they feel, well

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
this foreigner is coming over into my neighborhood, and making money off of me, and I can't even get a "Good afternoon" from them,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
well they don't know how to say "Good afternoon," but--it's the language barrier and the ability to

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
interact with people on a level outside of business.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: We're going to come to you shortly, not just with your questions,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but your comments about diaspora, your own experiences, your own backgrounds.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But, I want to ask each of you, starting with Ms. Kamau,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
being out here on the National Mall, uh, having Kenya, and having China,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
what does that mean for you? How do you feel about that?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: Alright, thank you

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's great. It's really--it's a proud moment. I'm like, oh this is- because, you know, this is the Smithsonian

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you have the best of the culture being showcased

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
um, in every aspect, and uh, people can interact just like Raymond was saying can go out and speak with the artisans, the participants.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's not just pictures, or you know, something that you see on TV.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But, you can actually interact with the people, and so that makes the experience all the more real

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and all the more inviting and a great experience for everybody all around,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so I feel great [[laughs]] to be here, I wish I could, you know, I'm at work, but I would love to come and spend and go to every single,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you know, demonstration and just visit and see what everyone is doing on a much more detailed level,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but it's absolutely beautiful to see this Folklife Festival is absolutely beautiful,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you know, every year it's a different country, different culture, but, you know that's what it's doing, is highlighting it.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I feel very proud to see all the artisans, and all the culture portrayed and demonstrated the way it is.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: And Mr. Wong from Hong Kong to Norfolk to Washington and then many diverse Chinese cultures within the national context of China are here on the National Mall.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
What's been your experience in interacting or have you had the chance to interact?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well yeah, definitely we need more events like these to bridge that gap with learning about each other and understanding.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.880 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, we learn enough, we can understand people. It's that lack of information that causes problems. Yes.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Questions, observations, about your identities and diasporas,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
where do you come from? Do you--when you say that you're an American or that you're from some place else what is that

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
really mean in the twenty-first century with all of the movements of people and ways of knowing and doing that are not just bounded by being from Norfolk or being from Washington

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but that you can find all over the world? Any questions? Observations? Yes ma'am.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Woman in audience</i>: Did you marry a Chinese or did you marry someone from here?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Did you marry, are you married?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Yes I am.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: First of all, did you marry someone from here, ah, is that, what is that person's identity?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Uh, yes I did marry someone from here. I met her at a bar.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[laughter]]

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yes, I did not marry Chinese, she's Filipina. Right--so yes.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Woman in audience 2</i>: Will your kids carry on owning a restaurant?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Will your kids carry on owning a restaurant?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Uh, only if they wanna do it. You gotta remember, restaurant work is --

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Woman in audience 2</i>: It's hard work!--

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: --long hours, and that's why I got out of it, because, I wanna be able to come to events like these, but if I ran a restaurant I wouldn't be able to do it. Yeah!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: OK, so you married a Filipina, you're a Chinese American. How do your kids identify? What is this term Asian-Pacific American? Does that mean- What does that mean for you?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Well it depends on the person, depends on the family upbringing. Uh, it's not so much your race, not so much what you're called, it's so much-

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it's more your cultural practices and how you live. It's your- what causes conflict is not what race you are, or what what you are called it's your cultural practices.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Does this group's cultural practice conflict with this group's cultural practices?  That's really about.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's- can we get along in a working fashion whether you're Irish, or Russian, or whatever. Can we get along? How close are our cultures?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: So in your household foodways, is it, what, is there one that dominates, or?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well, Filipinos eat a lot of rice; so Chinese eat a lot of rice. Filipinos eat a lot of pork, Chinese eat some pork, yeah.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Filipinos overcook their food [[laughter]], Chinese cook it just right, so we have some problems there! So, and Filipinos eat a lot of sweets,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so Chinese do not, so we have some issues there! And, what is more--there's other things too but we're not going to get into that. [[laughter]]

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: So one, just one last question to you before we go back to the audience.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, how old are your children? And are they old enough where they are interacting and people say, who are you? What are you? How do they identify?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well, I mean, they were raised to keep an open mind, to accept people for their actions and not their labels.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Because at the end of the day it's what a person does, what a person can accomplish.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's not what they call you because they can call you anything you want but if you accomplish nothing then we're zero, you know?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So it's a person's actions determine who they really are and not what they're called.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Ms. Kamau, do- is there a Kenyan community- not so much a fixed community but associations or civic associations or cultural groupings that you engage with?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: So there are very many cultural, civic, organizations based around church, around business, professionals,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and they are in the greater DMV area, actually they are all over the United States.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And so, I do interact with them, I'm not a member of any one, but there are a lot of social

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
activities and festivities around birth, or weddings or, you know, just regular cultural things, and a reason to get together and listen to Kenyan music and eat Kenyan food,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
this is what draws the communities together and network as well. So they do exist, and they are very active within the groups as well.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, I do also- I'm a member of African Immigrant Refugee Foundation and so that services many different African populations and just

00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
assists with navigating as new Americans, teaching them how to just navigate the system and understand the different culture.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Among the older Kenyan citizens, residents here in the United States, you identify as African American.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Is there another dominant category or predominant category in how other Kenyans, of Kenyan background might identify themselves?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: Well, I do, I do identify myself as Kenyan but because I've lived here so long I say, OK, I'm a Kenyan American, and I'm from Africa so I'm an African American.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That is how I interpret it and because I'm like, that's what I am, and so um, sorry, what was the question?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: No, that's good. 
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: OK, alright.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.940 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Yes sir.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Eduardo</i>: Thank you very much, very interesting topics, and the different type of presentations of the same topic from different viewpoints.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, my name is Eduardo, and uh I am actually from Central America, Honduras.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And as far as the Black diaspora, I am also a Garifuna, part of the Garifuna people out of Honduras.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And one interesting take is that when I came to this country, not being able to speak one word of English,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the people whom actually invariably embraced me were African Americans as opposed to the non-African descendant or the non-Afro Latinos.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So ironically enough I I would like to ask the question, sort of, how-

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
yeah, when you came here as an adult, whom were you embraced by, and and, as, you even though you came in as a child,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
how were you embraced by, let's just say the Chinese community, by the African American community, by others?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: So when I came I was a student, so I was in university, and at the time where I was there was a very strong African students association

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and so I joined the association because that's what I identified with. And so within that, for me,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it was great because I had never- I had met some different Africans from different African countries but never so many in one place.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And so that exp- so that was where the primary embracing was because it was--I s--it's not as--that, you know, it's a college town, and so within the college culture

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the African Students Association was the cultural group that we, you know, we cooked together, and that's--what--"Oh you guys cooked this!" You know, you inter--you find out,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
"Oh I know that word!" because of the Bantu languages have some root words in common. And so, for me that experience was learning about

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the differences and the similarities because, you know, for Africa it has been in the past, just like 'one' but it's so so so diverse;

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
even within each nation. So just learning those differences was wonderful. And that's where--that's where I was embraced first.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Mr. Wong?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:30.720 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: I can only speak like when I first got here I was like, almost two, so I don't remember that much, but if I just progress a little farther, when I was five or six, um

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: In my father's uh, Chinese restaurant. The customers uh, I don't remember seeing any white people. There were none.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
There were no other Chinese people, so it was all black. And uh, we had a juke box there uh, I remember some of the songs.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Okay uh, Fast domino and different things like that. Y'know, yeah it was like uh, five cents y'know,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
yeh, and I used to sing there too. Y'know I used to, right there next to the juke box.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Okay, and uh. The only white person I saw, was the milk man. Embassy dairy. He delivered the milk to the restaurant, and it came in bottles back then

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and occasionally I would see a cop. A white cop um, and for about a year uh, the other white person I saw was um,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I forgot his name now, but he would pick me, and take me to this farm in uh, Culpeper. Because my parents had to work they couldn't really take care of me, at that age.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They couldn't watch me, so they had, so they sent me there, to live with this farmer in Culpeper, so he would take me there.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He had other kids there too. So I guess they were the same situation. So uh, th- he took care of me.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He took me away Monday through Saturday, then Sunday he would bring me back. Spend a day.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So this went of for a couple of years, so m- cause my mother and father had to really work.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They, they, they work like fourteen hours a day in our restaurant. And

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
when I got old enough, six or seven, I got my chores in the restaurant. I had to do certain things, I was stock, stock boy,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and um, back then the only white people I saw were the cops, and watching t.v. It was chocolate city at that time,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it was really chocolate city. So, uh- and um it was tough getting along I mean, well getting by, because there weren't that many other Chinese there. It was only a few.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The hand laundry, our restaurant, and the Chinese in Chinatown. There weren't that many Chinese restaurants, throughout the neighborhood like there is now.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So uh, if a Chinese person walk on the street that's an odd thing. That was really an odd thing, and I uh, got called all kind of names.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
uh, Based on y'know uh, what the latest name is at that moment. Is a lot of different names they call you, but uh

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it was a lot of slang, thrown at me. So I went to public school uh, down the street from where the restaurant was, and um

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I mean according to my parents I had a rough time there, but I felt like it was okay. I didn't know the difference, but anyway,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.080 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but uh, that's pretty much my everyday uh environment, during the sixties

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: So in terms of growing up, hearing Fats Domino, do you sort of feel like Fats Domino's music is your music? It's not just 'those people's music'?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well you gotta remember, from the sixties all the way, the jukebox was there from the sixties to the seventies,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and then we got rid of it after the Martin Luther King riots,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because, uh like, I remember, like, ten people would come in with five cents to play one song so all ten people can stand there and listen to it,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and they weren't buying anything else! and my father was like, 'Oh you're--[[laughter]]

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you can't do that here!' [[laughter]] Yeah. Ten people would get five cents to come listen to one song. And they would dance and, you know,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and all the other customers were like, 'What's going on here? I want us some food!'

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So that's what happened then. So- uh, there was a lot of artists from the early sixties to the end of the seventies, yeah.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Have you visited China as an adult?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Yeah, I went back in 1985 and uh, but it's different now.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Talk a little about that.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Well, you know, I went back there in 1985, it was, it was still kinda hard to get in. I mean, it was not as free as it is now.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, it was a very- how do you call it? I'm not going to say primitive, but it was a very, I guess, country-like, most of China.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But it's it's totally different now. This was just, this was just before the changed everything and built high-rises.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So when I went back there it was um- I remember the lack of toilets.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[laughter]]

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yeah. Everybody went on the side of the road. Yeah, that's where they went. Uh, and everybody was a vendor.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Everybody was a vendor and at that time the Chinese who were from China, they went back as tourists.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
There weren't that many Americans there at that time. But now I'm sure it's different.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Miss Kamau how often do you visit Kenya?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: Not too often but I was last there two thousand--oh! Last year in January. I was there last year in January.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Did it have any particular sensory impact on you about being Kenyan-slash-black American here, versus who Kenyans are today?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: No, no. Once I'm home, I'm just home, you know? It's almost like when you're, you're just in a different um, time zone, you're in a different culture, you just, after the jet lag you just, you now, um,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
find that, you know, family members, catch up with family members and just-

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Who are your family members? Aunts, uncles, or just cousins?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: Yeah siblings. Aunts, uncles, 
<i>James Early</i>: And siblings?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: yes. Friends, it's very close.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: You have siblings in other places on the continent of Africa and/or Europe or other areas of the world?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: No. Well, I have other siblings here and in Kenya.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: The reason I ask that question is, you know, one of the things that we are seeing in this new diaspora

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Americans for many many years, and some of you will be quite familiar with this

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
or right here on Capital Hill, many congresspeople have in the last 20 years said 'I am proud not to have a passport.'

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
When I was a 19 year old sophomore in the Panama Canal zone in Central America with 8 military US bases there,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I would be hanging out with the G.I.'s, I was their age but I was not a G.I., I was a student.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And they would often say to me, 'Hey school boy! I won't see you for a couple weeks. I am going back to the world next week and I'll be back in 3 weeks.'

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That was a constant refrain. 'I am going back to the world.' Which meant that I'm nowhere.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The United States was the world and my children at 38 and 35, my oldest lives in east London, has lived there for about 14 years.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I think we are seeing more US children now, move around the world in the way we have seen the rest of the world, particularly in the south move a lot.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: So, I mean, I have a lot of friends and relatives who live in different African countries or in Europe or anywhere in the world

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because of work, marriage, you know, just because. Sometimes people just want to have a different experience.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, that, you're right is much more common now than it ever was, you know, before. So, that definitely is-

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: And from the things that we are seeing out here: the songs, the dance, the crafts, the culinary traditions,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the skills, the knowledge base. That moves and it tends not to be just identified with a flag or with a national anthem or with a border.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We are seeing in the southwest part of the United States, people who go home and come home in the millions,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
hardworking people who are everyday neighbors. And our laws are out of synced with our lived realities.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, before 9/11, this diaspora, something called Cedula Matricula, an identification card, there was an accident.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
People wanted to know about about 'How can I do a blood transfusion?' not whether I am looking at an alien or an illegal or an undocumented.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, we are seeing this push-pull and diaspora really is feeding that in new kinds of ways.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Other observations or questions from you. You may have different views about this topic.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
What diaspora are you from? Where is you family background? Does it extend outside of the United States?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
In the case of the Garifuna, a diaspora not only with regard to Africa but starting in St. Vincent in the Grenadines

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
in Barbados and you can find it in Honduras and, I think, in Guatemala.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Nicaragua. And New York City is perhaps the largest of the Garifuna community.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, what is it to be a US citizen or an American or what is it to be a Garifuna?

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We are now learning- or what is it to be Chinese or Kenyan or black American?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The new lived realities in terms of our cultural ways of knowing and doing a many many things.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.060 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, how are we on- Oh, we gotta- So, come on folk

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: I wanted to ask Mr. Wong, uh, your experience growing up in Chocolate City,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
how how has that affected at all, your working with martial arts and how did you get into martial arts? Why martial arts from cooking to martial arts?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Uh well [[chuckles]] uh--

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: [[heckler]] Tell it like it is!

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: Yeah yeah. Well I got into martial arts because uh, because I was having some rough times at school in Chocolate City.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And uh, of course I was watching TV and I see these guys kicking people and uh,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
taking them out in like, two or three moves; I said, 'Maybe I need to take some of that!'

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I just went to Chinatown of course--where else would I go, right?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Went to Chinatown, they had a school just opening up at that time -- this was back in the, uh, early seventies.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And right around that time that TV series came on, with David Carradine, called Kung Fu?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That just--and back then, June Ree was popular. Remember TV Guide?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Your TV Guide. He always had an advertisement in there, what, it was $12.95 or $19.95? You get a bag, and a uniform and a week's introductory lesson.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I looked at that, I looked at all this, said "OK, maybe I need to do this", you know?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I went down to take a lesson and, uh, I just found it interesting. I just kept on and here I am today, I have a school.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: I hope this doesn't put Ms. Kamau on the spot. Um, so you are at the National Museum of African Art in the capital of the United States of America.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So how many other African-borned folk are working there?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: Just myself.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: I raised that question because one of the principles of this festival and the Center for Folk life and Cultural Heritage is issues of cultural democracy. 

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, speaking of these intersections of diasporas and identities, when I came to the Smithsonian Institution

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
there were hardly any African Americans in professional positions, now there are tons of them.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We were not even talking about--well the term Asian Pacific American had just emerged.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And we were not talking about new African citizens immigrants and a major part of what we are interested in is how our country-- and we had this discussion yesterday with old curators,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
how this festival it's a sort of mirror for America when it was called the Festival of American Folklife,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
before it went to begin to deal with international communities, and now we're beyond the notion.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We still incorporate the notion of international communities but the question of diaspora communities

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I think it's a very important question for us in the United States and for us at the Smithsonian Institution, whose mandate is the increasing diffusion of knowledge.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Not simply how are we reflecting the world, with whom we are reflecting the world?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Because while you and I look alike and there are the obvious gender differences, people might assume that we still have the same psychological make-up

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and because-- we come from different backgrounds or the Garifona, we may look alike, or

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
There are other Asian Pacific Americans out here who may--I see people nodding their heads,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but say, well you look like Mr. Wong but you may be Indonesian American, or Filipino American

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and these are questions that I think this kind of program on the diaspora can help us in a very positive, affirming way

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
ask ourselves 'Who are all of us? and what-' as Mr. Wong was saying '-what kind of context are we building to look at how we treat one another'

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.050 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
just not make the assumptions of how we look at one another. Uh

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Yes sir and then I will come to, you know what let me do a gender--I have been speaking of democracy and then I will come to you.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Judy Kipngeny</i>: I have an observation. OK. Hi my name is Judy Kipngeny and I am a filmmaker and a Kenyan who lives in Kenya but is here for this week

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I think it's more of an observation because when I was very little I grew up in Washington D.C.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and returning home about the age of eight my fear was, you know, oh my God the animals are going to get me!

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
All the American fears that perhaps a little girl who would be American would feel.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And as someone who has sort of seen Kenya change very much,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the 90's a time of a lot of fear, a great dictatorship, and people who got onto planes didn't really come back or didn't want to come back or people were surprised when you came back.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And, I just wanted to observe that today I think, you know, thanks to perhaps the internet, thanks to a great understanding to what the world is there is a greater fluidity,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
people flow this way and then they come back. People who have been here for twenty, thirty years

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
seem to flow back into home in a more seamless kind of way and I just feel the world is kind of in a--even though there is so much negativity attached to globalization--there's there's a beautiful thing about how

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we're fearing less to see people move over to this side because they can come back and we are fearing less to be in Africa in our part of the world because we can come this way, sometimes.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: So you lived in Washington D.C.? So do you still feel a kind of identity? It's gone?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Judy Kipngeny</i>: I think the identity is more, I think it's a human identity because I think you know sometimes all this kind of curiosity and confusion about what America is,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
what Gathoni is doing out there in Washington, all of that has somehow you know with the fact that you don't mail a letter and get one back three months later.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You know? Everyone can, can e-mail on their phone or, or look up America. So, so it's not so much about feeling an identity or not with America,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:32.570 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it's more realizing that the differences are somehow, even though exaggerated by issues of poverty and so on, the similarities have just grown so much.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: I will come to this gentleman and then I'll come back to you and come to you and I think that will, you will be our last and we will go back and have Ms. Kamau and Mr. Wong  make closing comments.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Thanks for sharing your life experiences and I was actually thinking along the same lines as notion of fluidity

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I wondered if you would engage in a highly speculative thought experiment for me based on your own experiences and those of your extended family members?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
If there were no laws, there were no border fences, there were no border infestment, uh, enforcement, what do you think the world would look like?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Silence]]

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: If there were no restrictions of movement, no borders, no national, nationalities that made a difference, what do you think the world would look like?

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Gathoni Kamau</i>: That was a great question. [[laughs]] I am thinking as I speak but um, I think that the way we are as human people, we would find other issues to um

00:45:46.000 --> 00:46:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you know I think focus on, or, or make an issue of and other things would be the focus, but I really believe that

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
in the way you phrase the question would money be no issue either so people could just go wherever they wanted and do whatever they wanted because

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you know the green, always the grass always seems gra-greener on the other side and so if I had the money I would go everywhere to see the other side.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You know what I mean? Just to see it so I think just as a human being though and just meeting

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so many people from so many different parts of the world, because I have been able to be fluid and move around

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
although even in Nairobi I meet people from all over the world, it gives you that human curiosity of "Ah" I,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because you've made the connect and it's not disassociated from a screen or a picture, you like, oh, they just like me, you know they get angry or they get sad or they like this fruit and they don't like this.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, so the humanness of us becomes, it's like the, it's just, it is we are just human-beings and that takes more precedence

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and so you are drawn to a person because you met them and now you want to go to where they live and know more about them

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and increase that knowledge and just fill that curiosity and then make the conclusion and you're like "oh, I want to meet more people like this or I don't want to meet more people like this."

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it boils down sometimes to personalities and not to, you know one mean someone American doesn't mean there's a thousand beautiful, wonderful Americans, so it causes I think

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it would be great if we could just travel and come back and I don't know what we would-I what would dictate our identity

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you know? So, that's a great question, I don't know if it would be your language. I don't know.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Mr. Wong if we were able to just move about freely what do you think?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: That's a tough question, in what span of time? One year, five years, ten years, fifty years?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, it's hard to say but looking at humans: when you try to contain them, they try to get out.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
When you tell them to go out they come back. So, if you say you can go anywhere and be anything you want, they want they will try to dig their roots even harder

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and try to figure out what am I really because everybody else is all mixed up. So, I think they will do the opposite. Maybe.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Okay, good. I am going to take two last questions at the same time and as I walk to this gentleman with the mike the last time I looked at stats

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and this has a lot to do with diasporan culture all over the world, except on the continent of Africa, people are moving from the south to the north

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because of the great economic engine having to do with colonialism and all kinds of things are in the north except on the continent of Africa

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the great economic engine has been South Africa until recently Nigeria has become the largest economy.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, culture tends to flow where it can be fed, where it can be housed, where it can be clothed, where it can get healthcare, where it has family members and familiarity.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.010 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, as you think about diasporas and culture, there are these other factors.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: I thought I would share with Mr. Wong. It's not a question but I grew up during World War II a couple of blocks from here on Independence Avenue and

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the block was half black and half white and those were very interesting times. Because we had race battles, uh, between the half of the block that was black and half of the block that was white.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And I was scared as hell of all black people. And I ran from them, and I knew- I could go up the steps on my roller skates because if I didn't get up the steps I thought I would be killed.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But I think I've matured, Uh, I now have black employees and, uh, a Japanese wife.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I'm familiar with a lot of different aspects of the Diaspora and I think things are a whole lot better now than they used to be when I was a kid.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Silence]]

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Thank you for, uh, for the honesty and, uh, I think it points up a very important thing about Diaspora and Mr. Wong emphasizes at the outset.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: He was outnumbered. (Laughing)

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>James Early</i>: Ha,ha he was out-numbered.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Raymond Wong</i>: So he was Scared. 
<i>James Early</i>: And he also pointed that at the outset. But when we get to know one another

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
based on how we act as individuals in the context of the group from which we come,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we find out the diversity of that group, that culture, the complexity of it and we find our se- ways to one another uh,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I think we have a great example here of how history- once we were are segregated, but once we begin involved,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we have real opportunities to build community not just Diasporism amongst those from where we come.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, but to build this larger community that Mr. Wong answered. You have the last observation or question.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

<i>Jennifer</i>: Hi, I'm Jennifer, I live in the neighborhood, um, and I say this as a second-generation Hong Kong descendent.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, my- you know my parents and grandparents ran restaurants in the sixties and went through the race riots in Philadelphia. Not in D.C. but along the east coast.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And I think it's clear that Diasporic narratives clearly evolve over time and over generations.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And it was the hope of my grandparents that I would not have to work the long hours in a restaurant that they did

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and face the struggles that they did an- and rather enjoy the benefits of education and being a part of an educated professional class of Asian-Americans which has evolved over time.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And I'm proud that-that many of us are able to-to achieve that. And with respect to the Smithsonian's mission of-of disseminating knowledge,

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I think it'd be so great to see some of those contributions reflected in festivals such as this, um beyond-

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I think Five Spice Kitchen is a great and catchy title but how about, you know, 5 million contributions of Asians of the Diaspora in Science and Technology.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Politics and Law. Uh, Literature and Arts. I think that would be amazing.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, you know, I think we might have a little bit more to go in terms of what does the Diaspora look like over time and not just, uh perhaps in the immediate first-generation sense

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but second, third, and fourth as we see the legacy, uh , emerge. Um, I think that would be phenomenal. Thank you so much.
