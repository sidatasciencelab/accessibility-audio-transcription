Alright, first-timers, you're just in time 'cause this is our fifty-year anniversary. My name is Regie Cabico. I am the curator of this program called 'Capturing Fire'.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
If you don't know what Capturing Fire is, it is an annual queer spoken-word slammin' summit that happens in Washington D.C., going into its eighth year.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We've had phenomenal poets. As part of On the Move you're going to be hearing stories, spoken word poetry by people of color, children of immigrants, trans and queer identified performers. So we invite you to listen to our stories.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The takeaway message of On the Move. Since the beginning American culture has been shaped by the movement of people to and within the United States.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Recent immigrants with those who preceded them by generations or by millennia have contributed to the vitality of this country.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
An understanding of the resilience of heritage, the many shapes of community and identity, and the creative potential and tensions between past and future.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We have three phenomenal spoken-word poets whom you will be hearing from in the house. We have Gary Kay. [[applause]] We have Dia Bui [[applause]] and we have Jerrica Escoto. [[applause]]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So if there are any Filipino folks, make some noise, Filipinos! [[cheering and applause]] Alright, excellent. So I'm going to kick off this piece. This is dedicated to everyone who's had to check a box.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The government asks me to check one if I want money. I say, 'how could you ask me to be one race? I stand proudly before you, a fierce Filipino, who knows how to belt hard gospel songs played to African drums at a Catholic mass

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And loving the music to suffering beats and lashes from men's eyes of the capital's streets. Southeast D.C. with its sleepy crime. My mother nursed patients from seven to nine.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Patients gray from the railroad riding past civil rights. I walked their tracks when I entertained them at the chapel and made their canes pillars of percussion to my heavy gospel. My comedy out loud laughing about our shared stolen experiences of the South.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Would it surprise you if I told you my blood was delivered from north? Or Portuguese vessels who gave me spiritual stones and the turn in my eyes? My father's name where they conquered the Pacific isles? My hair is black and thick as nagrito, growing abundant the Sampaguita

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Flowers defying civilization like Pilapino pygmies that dance on the mountain. I could give you an epic about my ways of life or my look, and you want me to fill it in one square box?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
How could you tell me to fill Gilgamesh with all of its waters in the one square box? From what shape or integer do you count existing identities? Grant loans for the mind or Crayola white censor sheets? There's no One Kind to fill for anyone.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You tell me who I am, what gets the most money, and I'll sing that song like a one-man caravan. I know arias from Naples, Tunis and Accra, lullabies from welfare, food stamps and nature.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And you want me to sing one song?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:35.395 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I have danced jigs with Jim Crow and shuffled my hips to the sound of guitar of Clapton and Hendrix; waltzed with dead lovers, skipped to bamboo sticks, balleted kabuki and mimed catacalli, arrivederci the rhumba and tapped Tin Pan Alley, and you want me to dance the Bhagavad Gita on a box too small for a Thumbelina thin diva

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: They say be still. Be small.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Stay seated. Stop squirming.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: This may be your life but they'll say what it's made of.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: They say a little sweetener on a spoon will make it smooth when the meds go down.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: They say they have the recipe to make you function.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: They say poetry is dead or should be cuz words are useless.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Just whining and rhyming. Hypnotizing. Justifying. Proselytizing.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
As I'm giving appreciation for being here, I'm going to lower this mics.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
OK, that's all it goes-that's all-that's all-ba-all it does. Once again, my name is Dia Bui

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
uh, really proud to be here, queer and Vietnamese. So, the f- Yes, queer and Vietnamese.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I want to thank Regie for bringing us out here, Capturing Fire. Such a blessing to share the stage with the folks that you'll be hearing from.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, the first poem I want to share with you is about love.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Can we all agree that we are constantly on the move and at the center of that is love? So, here is poem about love.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I call you love

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
not because I don't appreciate your given name

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but when cynicism has us believing that love is fleeting

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
at least I know love has your permanent address.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
in a world where love has become a word we use too readily at the end of letters

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you learned to not let yourself be sealed in complacency like stone walls

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
echoing queer culture displaced in a generation and breaking bones and sounds were the only ways that we could tear ourselves out of the restraints of a straight jacket so we learn from history

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
build no emotional walls

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because there are too many and too high in Gaza

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Where former neighbors gaze into brute barriers to remember every hello before the concrete goodbye

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and must look upwards towards heaven in hopes that their prayers are still friends on the other side

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because spiritually, love knows no boundaries.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Unlike the heavily guarded borders under the- edging the ends of Mexico to the beginnings of San Diego

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
where families desperate to cross to get to their borders in hopes of their dreams

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
will only meet at the ends of Minute Men and the sharpshooters

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and there I know

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
love.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I'll take a minute then to think before I ever use my sharp tongue against you

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.748 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because when I first met you, I was desperately crossing to get to my

<i>Dia Bui</i>: And when we find love,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
make no mistake that the edges of these fingertips

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
will memorize every natural curve and every climb out of the reasons

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so when I write love poems,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
even the ink can understand you between the sheets.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I call you "love," not because it's the sweetest thing to call you

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but if I could write your name across the sky

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
even rainbows will know how to fall in love with you without clouded judgment.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They will understand that when the seasons change

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you are as constant as streams of consciousness.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, as we turn on the news, history will continue to repeat itself

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so there's nothing new about broken heart, shattered dreams, and the ongoing violence

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so maybe if we just sew our voices together

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
create our freedom quilts to wrap our struggles to keep them warm at night and in the morning,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you can whisper into my ears.

Create-

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Strum your vocal cords like violins,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
encrust the eardrums of the ongoing violence because your love,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
like music, can even teach enemies to sound like friends.

<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: What's going on, Folk Life? How are you all?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Good, good.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My name is Jericha Scodo.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I am Filipino. Trans. Queer.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And I just moved here from San Diego. So, I'm very proud to be here, on the National Mall.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The night I came out to my Filipino father,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it was the same night I prepared myself to no longer be somebody's child.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My father's silence resembled the way the earth sounds when we are already six feet underground.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And for a split second, dying,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
seemed a lot better than facing a man who has built my whole life with his two hands,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and telling him, I am nothing of what he expected me to be.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
When I told my mother that I was in love with a woman,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
she wept on our kitchen table and said, it wasn't normal.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Normal. I asked her, what does it even mean to actually be normal?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
In elementary, it was normal for parents to pack their kids peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I was the abnormal kid who had to sit outside by themselves

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because I was the weirdo with the peanut allergy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And the first time, I made out with my boyfriend in the 7th grade,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I called him the next day and told him I didn't want to do it again because

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I kinda felt like a ho. And he broke up with me.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He got with a girl, the next day, that didn't mind him sucking her face.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I found out. I went to the park where he played basketball with his friends.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I stopped the game, smacked him in front of his boys and I called him an asshole.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Later, I was told by teachers that behavior for girls actually isn't -- normal.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I figured out, at an early age, doing things normally isn't as fun as breaking all the rules.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And these days, there are a lot of things that just shouldn't be normal.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Like, it shouldn't be normal for you to shove someone deep into a closet

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and expect them to learn how to love themselves with the lights off.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It shouldn't be normal for someone to have to choose

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
between who they want to spend the rest of their life with

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and keeping their family for the rest of their life.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Bullying shouldn't be normal.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Hate crimes shouldn't be normal.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Waiting for the Supreme Court to decide whether or not, I can marry the only woman on this planet

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
who has ever put my nerves in suspension, shouldn't be normal.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
What, especially, shouldn't be normal,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
is that prickly, cacti shit, that grows on the outside of potatoes

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
when they have sat in your kitchen for too long,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's weird. It's creepy and it makes me feel highly uncomfortable.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But people like you, people like you say it is natural. And normal.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Personally, keeping something in my kitchen that looks like

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
a venereal disease isn't really my thing, but --

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I'm not one to be a potato-ist either.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I don't touch it. I turn my head, and I walk away

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because what a potato becomes, isn't really my business anyway.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, if holding my wife's hand makes you feel weird, creeped out or highly uncomfortable,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
don't touch us, turn your head and walk away.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Because what I do in my bedroom isn't really your business anyway.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I vow never to love my wife normally.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She will never feel like a habit or a routine.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I will always touch her with desperate hands,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
when I say "I love you," it will never sound synonymous to "goodbye."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She will never blend with any of my other thoughts or memories.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She will stand out because it is too much to not choose a love that is extraordinary.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It is too much to not say "I do" and actually mean "I do."

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Some say, coming out of the closet is a much too scary task.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.923 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I say, it is much more frightening living my life in darkness.

<i>Speaker 1</i>: Speaking of on the move I didn't mention where my family moved here from, my parents and my big brother moved to the United States from the country of Sri Lanka.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: and you probably had heard a slew of different topics

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: It has everything to do with having to survive,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: or making decisions that require you to move one place to the other

<i>Dia Bui</i>: or when it is the closest, it still doesn't feel like home,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: Is there acceptance? Is there tolerance? Is there a way for anyone to embrace me?

<i>Dia Bui</i>: had to hide in the closet so she medicate

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: society shame and the pain was too much to take

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: cried tears of joy when you fell in love

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: don't matter to me if it's him or her'

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: and in the track, this is her poem

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: 'Living in the shadow can you imagine what kind of life it is to live

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: in the shadows, people see you as happy and free bu-because that's what you want them to see.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: The world is changing and they say it's time to be free

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: but you live with fear of just being me

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: living in the shadow feels like a safe place to be

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: no harm for them, no harm for me

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: but life is short, and it's time to be free

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: love who you love because life isn't guaranteed'

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: so in this next poem, I'd like to share with you

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: is about my experience living in DC as a queer woman of colour,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.240 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: and trying to survive every day as a queer woman of colour walking these streets.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Dia Bui</i>: On some days, I love to meet new people in random places

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
in this city, walking can be a mode of communication

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but for a queer woman of color, every step is like morse code

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
anything can be seen as sending signals

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
there are just some places my body prefers to keep quiet

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
prefers to look ahead, prefers that no one looks, speaks, or even breathe

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
at me, my head sideways, tilted at a slight angle because

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
most days, walking queer can mean violence

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it means that at any given moment, any given space

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
cis men of all shapes and sizes will come at me

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and my girlfriend sideways and at all directions

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
they'll catcall my partner before ever knowing her first name

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and when she speaks up for herself

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
call these men out on unwanted remarks as their tongue coils

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
like the barrel of a gun, they'll fire rounds of their insecurity

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
like 'Damn it's a compliment. You can't take a compliment?'

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and continue to berate her for talking back

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it's triggering, it's psychological, emotional, and even physical

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
warfare, like when a white man in khaki shorts and boat shoes

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
on U street dares to stick a piece of paper in my partner's top

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and says 'it's just flirting' my fist curls up

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I feel a burning anger like the only resolution is to fight

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
violence with violence. my body can't contain itself

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
from being harassed, then witnessing assault of any kind

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I know, I know

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I should be giving him bell hooks instead of my left ones

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but not even [[Applause]] Thank you

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I should be giving him bell hooks instead of my left ones

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because most days, we are violated on the streets

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Not even sidewalks are wide enough for safe spaces

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
No prayer that I can stomach to keep her safe from the onslaught of gaze

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the straight whistles flying freely from misogynistic

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
lips, and the hissing threats of rape or sounds that send chills down my spine

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I constantly agonize, over not having more of a backbone

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
to withstand the heaviness of this violence

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I wait to get home

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I hurry into the bed that we share, hold her under the covers

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I tell her 'I love you' as prayers still lift us into sunrises

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it's the only way I know how to keep carrying ourselves

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.110 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
through the violence, that while the mainstream rejoices over sex-same marriages

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Same-sex marriages, all we are really trying to do is survive walks around our neighborhoods

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Cheering]]

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Hello

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[SILENCE]

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: So I have a series of poetry entitled 'My American Father'.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: There's three parts to it I'm going to do the first part here.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: And I always write a new part when I'm in a different part in my life, in my relationship with my father has evolved

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: So, this first part I wrote in 2009

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: And it was still when I was still trying to figure out the language of what this tension was between me and my father.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: And I have a women's studies degree, a BA and a Masters

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: And so women's studies really helped me to formulate the language

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: In order for me to start healing

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and kind of reassemble this relationship with my father.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[SILENCE]

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I've swallowed so much pride that the confines of my stomach

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: only grumble wasted dignity and the word 'daddy'

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: in between desperate attempts of regurgitation.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: This poem stands juxtaposed with my critical tears.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: An [[??]] critical condition,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: too critical for movement except for when immigrated fathers don't feel good enough for Americanized children

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and when Americanized children don't feel food enough for immigrated fathers.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: And I wonder, daddy, if someone would of told you it was gonna be this hard, would you of stayed?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Because you've aged drastically,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and the permament creases on your forehead only show timelines of your struggle

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: you work your ass to own up to an American dollar but you've been slipping,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: as each dollar went to us first, first-place should always feel rewarding

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: but as first generation children I would of took second, or third,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: or hell maybe even none at all and daddy,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: amongst America, branding inadequate confidence into your hard work you forgot to tell me you loved me first.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Amongst American standards, stapling your immigrant lips shut with deferred dreams

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: you forgot to teach me the tounges of our ancestors and I'm left exposed

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: with red and white stripes down my wrist a blue heart

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and eyes, full of shooting star tears because my struggle, daddy,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: has nothing to do with my golden skin,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: has nothing to do with a third world bending their backs to reach first

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: how could you tell me that I'm not so different from you when I was born birthmarked with privledge and you,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: born nothing but a brown man, born nothing but a yellow man

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: but these days you turn nothing but all black a shadow, daddy,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I would of stopped you if it meant you being an American first before my father.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I would of never accepted the big houses and fancy cars if it meant you hiding behind them,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: if it meant living in the same house with just a floating body with no substance, daddy,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: you didn't have to throw your bottle of dreams into the ocean in hopes that it would float onto American soil.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Because now, our conversations consist of me spitting standards onto your beliefs

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and piercing your intelligence with 'you don't understand' before I ever even gave you the chance to speak.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I'm sorry I was the white man before your child.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I'm sorry I was another staple on your lips in a conversation too heavy to speak

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I want to say more to you than just bullshit about student loans and Sunday afternoon football games

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I want to tell you about all the times my heart has been broken and how it could of been prevented

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: if I had just stayed daddy's number one so daddy, I'm here to take back my title.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I'm here to build love poems down your spine to help you stand taller as my father.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I'm putting on my chinelas and racing accross country hitting every flagpole in this nation

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: replacing the American flag with your picture lets show 'em daddy.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.020 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Lets show 'em what its like to really dream.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Have people heard of 'Found Poetry' before, or 'Found Poems?'

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So, Found Poems can come in very different shapes and sizes.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: One way to do found poems is just do something like pick up a book,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: that you have, or a newspaper and look through, and just

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: take phrases or just sentences or just words that you wanna use

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and craft a poem out of that. You can also take entire pieces

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: of text and play with them. and turn those into found poems

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So this is a found poem that I wrote

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: or rather, found,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: On Earth Day this year, I was visiting family,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and we were at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and I was reading an exhibit on sedimentary minerals

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and rocks. and learning lots of things. And I found myself reading one of the

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: curator's signs explaining some of the principles of sedimentary minerals and rocks,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and I thought, 'You know, I feel like this paragraph would work if I just pulled out one phrase

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and put another phrase in its place.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: so, what I've done here, is taken any instance of the phrase

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: 'sedimentary minerals and rocks'

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And changed it to

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: 'People of the Global Majority'

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: which is another term for People of Color

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: People of the Global Majority

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: are extremely varied, differing wildly in texture, colour, and composition

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: In total, these people cover about three-quarters of the Earth's surface

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Nearly all are made of materials that have been moved from a place of origin

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: to a new place of deposition

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: The distance moved maybe a few feet

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: or thousands of miles

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Most People of the Global Majority form in layers --

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Or strata -- Many contain fossils

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Applause]] 
[SILENCE]

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I'm still lost, I don't have a found poem.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I brought up a couple things before my last poem, uh, for today

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Uh, first of all, once again my name is  DÃ­a BÃ¹i. I lived in DC for seven years, just moved to New York

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I joined an agency called the "The Soze Agency," one of our really proud accomplishments

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: is partnering with four-dot-US to put out immigrant heritage month, and so if y'all didn't know, this is the last day

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: of Immigrant Heritage Month, I'm wearing the shirt "I Stand with Immigrants".

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I have stickers to give out, I'm more than happy to share, I'm proud to do so

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I have stickers "I am an immigrant" "I stand with immigrants"

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and it's so appropriate for On the MOve, today at the National Mall.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: In Washington D.C. so please feel free to take some, love for you to share with your friends and families.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: You stand with immigrants, if you are an immigrant, we celebrate you

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Uh -- We are the fabric of this country among many, many groups and folks

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: I see -- uh -- somebody walking with "I am an Immigrant" T-Shirt! Yee-ees!

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Alright, so, more than happy to do that. uh-- just want to give a shout-out to

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: The Youth of Color, who come from immigrant families, who are here today

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: that I had a blessing to work with -- Asian-American League, Young People if you can show yourselves, Let them know that you're here -ish

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.580 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Yes, I know, it's being forced [[Applause]]

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Um, I'm Vietnamese. My family comes from Vietnam.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They were part of the boat refugees who came to the US.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So when I think about migration, I think about how people move,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and the reasons for they move and a lot of them have to do with survival.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So my story is about survival and it continues to build-

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It will be about survival and so this poem that I wrote more than two day-

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh a decade ago when I started this journey in poetry is called "The Anthology."

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And I'd love to close this out with this poem.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh and as I'm working on putting together a collection of poems this will be a part of it.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The Anthology is dedicated to the real life stories and struggles of the following Southeast Asian women,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I honor their strength, courage, and wisdom. They are [[?]] my mother who was a refugee from the Vietnam War,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Denise Alfonco, author of "To The End of Hell," one woman's struggle to survive the Cambodia Khmer Rouge,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and Lillian Alletle, the mother of the late Joseph Alletle who was killed in a hate crime in 1998.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've been writing about the stories that matter to me the most.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Unlike fictional novels, these stories are undeniably profound,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and the English classes with the all American teachers

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
do not understand what it means to have an identity hyphenated, Vietnamese-American.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've been writing about the issues that matter to me the most,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
about the people who were still [[?]] for refuge but have never found it.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The war that gave birth to the refugees who sought for refugee but have never found it.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My homeland is still struggling for freedom and equality,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
my country is still divided between simplicity and democracy.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The poor are on their hands and knees while conscious citizens are dying to speak.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Where are the human rights...

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
for the Vietnamese?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've been writing about the struggles that matter to me the most like those that belonged to my mother who escaped Haiphong Vietnam in '81 and barely made it past the coast,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
drifting solemnly at sea with no mother, with no father, with no brother, no sister.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She was holding on to the hands of strangers crowded on a small wooden boat and,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
with no food and with no water and with no idea whether or not she would live or die and only...

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
by the grace of hope, she was able to survive.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've been writing about her story as I wipe tears from my eyes, crying because I know the pain [[?]] will never die.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She gave birth to her first child just so hope would never die.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And in America she trusted, the America that gave her two shifts and two jobs instead of an opportunity for education,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
her America told her, your opportunity is an assimilation, remember because this is your education

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and for most of my life all she has ever known is [[?]]through her bare hands.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
ON the day that I was born, she held me in her arms and whispered,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
"You will not suffer as I have, you are an American.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[Speaks Vietnamese] [Translates]: I am Vietnamese-American."

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I've been listening to the voices in my surrounding communities,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
from the, those who understand the fall, the murder the spirits of the free, like my [[?]] brothers and sisters carrying on the devastations of their mothers and fathers

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
from the same war that gave birth to ruthless leader. The Red Rouge with the red rifles with the red hands and the red butt stains on the killing fields and broken lands.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
A wife can never forget the images of her husband being slaughtered, as much as she tries she can't.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And in her memories are images of her daughter dying from hunger. A mother can never forget. As much as she tries she can't.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I've been learning from the elders who come before me seeking peace from the unanswered American dream

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
like the mother of a Filipino postal worker whose son was shot nine times in broad American daylight, so I ask why?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Why is a brother too Asian and not just American?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So now I've been speaking about the issues that matter to me the most.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
In all struggles of life, we most remain strong so please remember these words deeper than your hearts:

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Keep on fighting, do not be afraid, [repeats phrase in Vietnamese twice]. Right?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.530 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And speak about the stories that matter to you the most.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: One more poem. Are y'all still good? Hydrated? Good.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um. So, I was talking about the different parts...um...

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The different parts of my life where I write poems to my father, um.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I actually will be back on the stage at 2:45 with Regie Cabico

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
uh, we're doing a conversation on what it is to be Filipino and queer and other poems, so

[clears throat] I will do the other poems there, but, uh, I wanted to do this poem because

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
particularly now in my life, uh, I just started identifying as being trans about a year ago

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and, um, it's not something that I have come out and told my parents yet because

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
coming out as being gay was hard enough and that took about ten years of healing.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, so I'm going to do this poem now which is the first poem I've ever written

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
about identifying as being trans

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, sort of... to my father hoping he hears me all the way in California.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[SILENCE]

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Some nights,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I wake up choking to the woman inside of me trying to claw her way out of my mouth.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She waits until I am sleeping because it is the only time I do not try to forget her.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Sometimes, when I am alone, I can hear her weeping in between the times I inhale and exhale.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
When I bind my chest, I feel more than just the suffocation of my body,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I feel hurt inside of me, gasping for air.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I know she is terrified I am trying to squeeze her out of me for good.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
For a while, I tried. I swallowed her in front of other men to not seem weak.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I stiffened up every time I felt her welling up behind my eyes.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Used her as a scapegoat the times anger was the only prayer in my mouth.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Blamed her for the depression, the anxiety, the dysphoria,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the dirty looks in public restrooms and fitting rooms for being a goddamn box

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
To check on paperwork, I hated her for having the audacity to stay

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
even after I demanded her to leave.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I also mourned, and I grieved.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I didn't know how to say goodbye, I didn't know if I had to.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
When my therapist told me I have internalized misogyny, I cried.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Until the woman in me finally poured out my eyes and onto the floor

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She has never said I told you so, she has only ever offered me a book of poems

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
written by the person I used to be, and now, here, in front of this mirror that I

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that I begged to tell me lies,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I am desperately looking for something that resembles something familiar

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but I've only ever performed by poems in a higher pitch and I fear a lower frequency

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
will have me relearn what it means to be quiet when all I want to do is scream

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I am here, this is me, but my refusal to remember her is also my refusal to become a man

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
who does not fall victim to fragile masculinity, to be a man

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
does not mean to forget all the parts of me that is woman, that is soft,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that is compassionate, that is the only version of myself that I have ever been damn proud of.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
To become the day, that I can embrace my femininity, will be the day I have stepped

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
into my true masculinity.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I would be lying, if I said the noise of patriarchy does not keep me up at night sometimes

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I let her out before I go to bed, we do not speak.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I do not remember the last time I looked her in the eye but she just lies

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
next to me, quiet, she puts her arms around me and reminds me I am not alone and

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.790 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Sometimes, it is the only time I can be put to sleep.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: To dismiss her, is to dismiss the fact that she is the reason why I am still alive.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I am nothing, without the parts of me I have been and will become.

<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I am nothing, without the woman who lives inside of me.
