00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
to realize that when we have immigrant parents, the dialogue of, "we sacrifice so much for you, we did so much to you,"

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I've made promises I wasn't ready to make. Said things that felt like salt on your taste buds because I wasn't ready to say them yet,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I realized, the reason why I write so many breakup poems, is because I'm not done writing the one about you.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Sometimes love is violent. And you took your loaded insecurities and threatened me at gunpoint the whole time I loved you diligently.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: You taught me that sometimes love isn't even really called love, it is just called perseverance. I stopped believing in gods when you became the one I prayed to, but you never listened.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I came to you with bloody knees and wrinkled palms from the times I pressed my hands together for you, but you never listened.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: You only recognized your worth in funhouse mirrors and the times I unzipped my own spine and turned it into a bridge you could walk on.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Most days, you never really knew where you were headed and I reshaped the road maps of my life to crack enough pavement for you to follow because sometimes love isn't even really called love,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: it is just called sacrificing your own bones and hoping that one day, you'll actually get a goddamn "thank you"-- When you left...

<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And I have been waiting here, letting you leak out of me through my behavior, waiting for justification from you as to why you

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: felt that you had the audacity to make me fall in love with you the way that I did, but never love yourself long enough to let me.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I've spent too many nights throwing dictionaries against the wall for never finding the right words to get you to stop hurting me.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I should've borrowed yours. You always knew the right things to say to get me to disintegrate slowly.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I waited years for our beginning. And I know now, that sometimes love is the umbilical cord that wraps around the necks of unborn children-- sometimes things that are supposed to have a beginning die before they ever even have a chance to start,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: You never let me talk long enough to realize that this isn't what love is supposed to feel like, you weren't what love was supposed to speak like--

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Love isn't about learning how to make love with the lights off.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: It isn't about holding on for the times when you could finally love me back--

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.180 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I know now that sometimes love isn't even really called love, it is just called...letting go.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Jerrica Escoto. Alright -- this is really, really rare, where you can have two queer Filipino spoken word artists on stage.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Also from different coasts. As you know, I grew up here in the east coast, not far from D.C., southern Maryland.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So, we're going to start a little bit of a dialogue, and we hope that you will join in and ask questions and/or share whatever you have.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: I just want to start with -- poetry is not the traditional Filipino thing, either dancing or singing.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Right, where in "Miss Saigon", you don't see us as poets. But I do wanna say that there is something in the Filipino culture, which is we call "O.A.", which is drama.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So we're full of drama, we also have a sense of humor.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: "O.A." stands for "Over Acting".

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: "O.A." So like, "Regie, you're so O.A.!" So it means overacting. So I feel like, for me, I -- being a spoken word reformer, it was a way of surviving,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: and it was a way to make sense of my world being Filipino-American.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: I think if-- I have two siblings, we're creative in our own way. And if we didn't have that, I don't know that I would really survive.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: I don't know that I could be silenced.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So, I'm writing to make sure that the Filipino stories are out there, and also so that way I could connect with all of you.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So I wanted to put that out there, just -- just to see how you respond.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Because you grew up in San Diego, where there's a lot of Filipinos.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah, I grew up -- where we were predominantly either Filipino or black.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I actually didn't really meet a white person until high school, because I was constantly around people of color.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And it -- same thing for me. Poetry -- I was writing my whole life, and then

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I went to a slam-- a poetry slam--  when I was 18, for a high school, like, extra-credit thing, and um...

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I realized that it was a pathway for us to tell our stories that we didn't realize were important to tell.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And I'm really grateful that I found it, because oftentimes when we think our stories don't matter, whatever that story is,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: whatever to our capacity, um, I think that we end up carrying that inside of ourself, and then we wonder why it feels so heavy sometimes.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Or when it gets lifted,  why we were in so much pain that whole time.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: So poetry is definitely a healing thing. Every time I get up on a stage-- whether it's for 100 people, 1,000 people, or just 1 person-- I really take myself

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: somewhere that I don't usually go in front of my peers, or in front of my family really. And poetry is a way for me to speak to my

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: parents... when I don't really have that vulnerability to speak to them face-to-face.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Um, I also want to talk about your family, who's truly incredible. You have an other brother who's also queer and

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: My family is not as supportive and so um, I came out because... there was an anthology that said "Regie Cabico is a gay Filipino!" I'm like,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: "Surprise everyone! Hahaha..." And this is before Will and Grace, and um, I think, being Filipino, you're also-- religion, and being an immigrant,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: like you can't be different, you need to conform, you need to do this... So for me, to be a poet, was I had to break all, all ties.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So, there is still a part of me, while my sisters and-- and the younger generation's very supportive... it's great that you have... that amazing support.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah, it-- it took my parents, um... a long time, I think maybe 10 years. So, I have 2 older sisters and a younger brother. He's only a year younger than me, um, and he's gay.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And so basically, what the story was, is my parents kept trying and trying for a boy. When I came out a girl, my parents, like, cried.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And then, they were like "One more time," and they had my brother, and my brother ended up being gay. And so my joke is, "Do you see what happens when you mess with God?"

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Regie, some audience laughs]] 
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: This is just their way at getting back at them for being uh, so disappointed.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: But, it took them a while, even when I was engaged to my now wife-- my wife is Pakistani, and she's Muslim--

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Audience member yells something and claps]] 
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Us growing up-- [[Jerrica laughs]] holla! Um, us growing up Catholic, um, all my parents knew about Pakistan is that

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Muslims were the bad, stereotypical things that they see on the TV and the internet. And so, oddly my parents

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: actually ended up having to move to Bahrain, which is a Muslim state-- uh, country maybe? Both?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And so, they were immersed in a whole different culture, and it really allowed them to open their eyes. And now

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: we're in a great place, together. But I do identify as being trans-- this is something I've been identifying with for the past year,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: and I have not come out to my parents for that. Just because, it took so long to get to this really nice place.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Um, and I'm really afraid to kind of shake the boat again-- which, really speaks to like, kind of the experience you have as second

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: generation is, you're just trying to make your parents proud of you. And so you don't really want to... expose anything to them that may disappoint them again.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: And I think, on that last-- so you just want to make your parents proud of you-- I feel that, growing up, my mom looked at myself not as this human being

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.920 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: but as this thing. And, um, it was hard to

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: --sort of separate that, y'know? And when I have Filipino friends who say, "Well you're family to me," um, it sort of has...

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: a very warped or twisted sensibility. So for me, when I can commune and share the stage with you, it's such a, a healing process, for me--

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: um, to be here, and on the Mall.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Um, so, I-- I guess if you wanted to respond to that...

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah, um, I was doing spoken word poetry in a competitive place,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: for th-- some of you don't know, there's something called poetry slam,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: um, which is basically, we perform these poems that make us very vulnerable, that make us cry--

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: and we let strangers judge us. It's, like, the most abusive thing we could do to ourselves. [[Regie laughs]]

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Um, but I've been doing it for 10 years, I did it nationally and internationally,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: and I was-- I just kept competing, kept competing, but-- uh, and Regie sa-- I told Regie this before we did this show,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: I never do poems that have to do with me being Filipino, or having immigrant parents,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: because I know those poems don't score very well in a competitive stage.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Um, the poems that-- that score well, um, are very far from my identity, or um, they're a narrative that's not my own,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: and so I don't feel comfortable saying a story that's not my own. Some people will, for the scores, um,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: but for my own values I just don't. Um, so this is really nice, because it's really hard to find

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: um, a community of Filipino poets where all of our stories, um, are kind of aligned, and our values are aligned, and

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: um, other people can hear them, together, rather than sprinkling them every now and then.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Um, I'd love to trade it over to you-- you're such a beautiful audience, um, and so it-- it's--

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: with you being vulnerable on the Mall, it's hard to tell who's listening, you feel like you're on the radio,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: but there's actually people... here. So I want to thank you for being very, very, um, attentive and-- and with us.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So, we'd love to trade it over to you, um, and um, we have our Folklife Festival,[[minor applause]] phenomenal, staff person here with a microphone,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So if you have any questions for us, this is our second show today and, like, right now we're--we're like--

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Oh my god, yeah. [[both laugh]]

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.310 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: But we'd love to-- please energize us, and-- and, share your thoughts, or questions .

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Yes.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[[Silence, barely audible murmuring]]

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: So um, it's more of a statement rather than a question, um,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: I just wanted to say that, both of what-- [[Mic feedback]] ooh! Both of what you guys said was really amazing.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: There aren't a lot of people, like you said, um, that are willing to put themselves out there and be vulnerable, and I think

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: both of your sessions, um, my team was here, listening to what you guys had to say.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: And um, it was really amazing! I mean, the kind of stuff that you're saying, is not something that's usually broadcasted on the National Mall.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: So um, more of I just wanted to say thank you for sharing your thoughts and how you feel--

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: because I think a lot of people feel the same way, and they support however you feel.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Thank you. And I think, um, us being on the National Mall and saying our stories is even more important because of who's in office.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Um, y'know I mentioned that my wife is Pakistani and her mom is still in Pakistan and is sick,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: and uh, she wants to be able to go back home and visit, but we're in the middle of our own immigration process and so she's actually afraid she won't

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: be able to get entry back in. Um, even though Pakistan is not part of the list of countries, part of this new travel ban, it's still

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: a scary thought--

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: You never know what's gonna happen, like--

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: surprise! 
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah. Right.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: And so to-- to speak my story so very loudly on the National Mall, um, is sort of like a, a bittersweet

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: kind of experience for me, um... because ever-- ever since I moved to D.C., it's been very heavy for us,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: and our-- every single day we have to remind ourselves to heal, and to be grateful for what we can be grateful for.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Because once we step outside it's a huge reminder, um, that our identities, y'know, are not really aligned with who's in office right now.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Um, but thank you-- yeah, for saying that. It is really important for us.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: I also just wanna give a shout-out to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival-- 'cause when I asked Siachen about, well, what should we say, what should we not say,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Siachen says, "We will not censor you, say what you want, use your judgement. It's your story."

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: So, um, that-- that's really really powerful, too, for them to be able to say that to us. And I think we underestimate,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.390 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: um, the power of free speech while we still have it, um, as poets. [[Both chuckle]]

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Audience Member</i>: So first, thank you for sharing your stories.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You both touched on how poetry has kind of been a way for you to share your own personal stories,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but you also mentioned in slam poetry, that your stories didn't necessarily score well with judges.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I was wondering if both of you could talk about how you found

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
kind of a community -- of if you found a community -- within this poetry scene to

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
be able to safely be vulnerable and share your stories

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
without kind of fear of rebuke or not scoring well or whatever it is.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Um, I think right now Regie is my community,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we just booked a SoCal tour in August and September,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
we are doing a photo shoot next week and we're just really happy to have

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
two powerful, Filipino, queer poets. [[clapping]] Thank you.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: And I have never -- like, I'm about, 97 years old,  and I've never performed in San Diego

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and so it should not be -- I shouldn't like -- I have to do it.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It's sorta like a Mecca; I have to be there.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah, and San Diego's poetry scene is really huge,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
their teams always top-- are always top five in the nation every time.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And so it was really hard being on a team.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My first team was in 2010 and I was the only Filipino on the team and all my other

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
teammates were African American, and my coach

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
had made a comment that we were an all black team.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And it just kinda affirmed for me even more that me being Filipino was really invisible,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and that -- and I didn't really know how to negotiate that because I grew up with predominately black folks and I

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
was so far away from my own Filipino identity

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that it took me being now 29 to realize that

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
it really hindered my own personal and spiritual growth.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Especially in my poem that I read when my grandmother was passing away.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She was in hospice care,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and it hit me when I started saying goodbye to her in English

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and I just felt this rock in my stomach when I realized

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that it took her dying for me to realize that

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I should have learned our native tongue.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So that we could have communicated much more.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I think the community is still evolving;

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I'm happy I have Regie here, I thought when I moved to D.C. I would retire from performing--

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: No, don't!

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Jerrica Escoto</i>: Yeah, but no it's great

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I'm always still looking for community, right?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Not even in just the poetry space,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
just to watch Game of Thrones.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Shout out to Game of Thrones fans, July 16, holla!

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yeah.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Regie Cabico</i>: Um, I started to slam 24 years ago in 1993 at the Nuyorican Poets CafÃ©

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and when I was on the slam team, I had Tracie Morris, Maggie Estep, and Hal Sirowitz and myself.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So yes, I was the young, gay, Filipino poet, but I looked at ourselves as the Avengers

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
just doing our thing and our poetry and I felt a little bit of community there.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I did not have community growing up, just generationally I wish that there were

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
queer artists that could, sort of, lead me. But I think we're talking about the AIDS epidemic and that huge gap.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So it's only in the time now that I'm finding community with the younger generation,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and so I'm trying to sort of bridge the older and the younger so we can get work done and we can move on an intergenerational shift.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But, I do have to say that it's sometimes a challenge with the younger millennial generation who, as I say is so laser-eyed and furious.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They will take apart a lot of my writing and there is some valid discussion to that,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but at the same time we need to move and we need to mobilize, we don't have time.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Like, this is, like, this is we, we've got to, like, figure it out and move together, alright? Like.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I just wanted to say that on the intergenerational level I was talking to [[Bocea?]], about how people are offended in poetry these days by, "this was appropriation", "you did this", "this, that."

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And [[Bocea?]] said "You know, my dad's 96 years old,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
he's been through so many wars, he could say oriental if he wants to."

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:29.230 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I just wanted to sort of give that, on how we can understand each other and to move on the intergenerational level to just, for us to get things done.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
{Speaker 1} Thank you for your question {{/Speaker 1}} {Speaker 2} I think there is time for one last, one last thing [[pause]] or two last things. {{/Speaker 2}} [[Pause]]

00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
{Speaker 3} It's clear both of you all have a very strong identity to your Filipino culture. I'm curious whether that still is your community that you can come in or out of it. If its strong or you've actually been ostracized and have to identify with someone else either your cult--uh your uh literary community or something else. {{/Speaker 3}}

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
{Speaker 4} Um, I actually am more ostracized than I think welcomed in primary Filipino communities. A great example is th--the last-- or the second to last poem I did was actually a group piece that I did with another Filipino Poet on a National Semi-Finals stage, and at the end, Um-- I'm so--there's like 87 dialects in the Philippines and our-- our family speaks something called Kapampangan and we don't speak Tagalog

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So um, and my poetry partner who did the group piece, his--his family speaks Tagalog So at the end, you know, we are saying kaluguran daka which  means "I love you" in Kapampangan I'm saying patawarin mo ako which means "please forgive me" to my grandmother.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And obviously I don't have the accent and my tongue isn't really trained to have it sound I guess pure Kapampangan and so we actually had a Filipino poet from Austin bash us on Facebook saying that we didn't have the right to be on a stage if we weren't going to be able to speak the language correctly, when the whole poem was about the fact that we were trying to find that.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We were trying to find that connection with our language, we were trying to find that connection with our ancestors and our grandparents and our parents, um and often times when I perform in an all Filipino space, I'm often seen as someone who's not too much of an activist for just solely Filipinos just because a lot of my activism

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
is in the broad spectrum of LGBTQ and people of color in general. So I'm not as comfortable in an all Filipino space unfortunately. The spaces that we're booked for in So Cal a lot of them are predominantly Filipino spaces, uh but for me I'm still trying to become comfortable

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and trying to negotiate what it means to be uncomfortable in a space with people who look like me and much more comfortable in a space with people who don't look like me.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.220 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So it's still evolving for me for sure. {{/Speaker 4}}
