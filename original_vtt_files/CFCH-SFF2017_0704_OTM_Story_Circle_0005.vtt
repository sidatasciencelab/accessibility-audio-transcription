00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So uh, where is everyone from today? [laughs]

<i>Speaker 1</i>: If you folks haven't already visited the art and industries building, it's just right across the mall, next to the castle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: There's a marketplace there, you can buy all kinds of incredible musical gifts, books, artifacts, textiles, jewelry -- all kinds of great stuff there.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Um, a lot of it is also featured by the heritage fellows that have been performing with us and been featured.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: Good afternoon, can everyone hear me? Hello! [Laughs] Uh, I am Perla Guerrero.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: I am assistant professor of American Studies and Latino Studies at the University of Maryland at College Park.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: and I am a scholar of race, labor, and migration, so it's my pleasure to be here to facilitate this panel discussion, um, "Intersection of Personal Stories and Immigration Policy."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: So, I'm going to let everyone introduce themselves, but the idea behind this panel is to get a little bit more information about immigration, displacement, movement, something beyond the typical, kind of expected story of looking for a better life,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: because policy is very important in defining who can enter the country,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: who can not, who can stand in a so-called line,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: who can quote-unquote "do it the right way."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: Um, a quick little bit of information is just that there are usually numerical limits on countries of origin.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: And, there are different numbers for different countries, there are different considerations, depending on if there's an environmental disaster if there's a war

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: the US, the United States, position on a war, determines whether people being displaced by war are actually recognized as refugees or not.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: In this area, some of you may know that there are a lot of Center American Americans,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: um, that were displaced due to civil wars in El Salvador, Nicaragua, in Guatemala,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: but many of them were not ever recognized as refugees, meaning that they had to enter as undocumented immigrants,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: and so they have US citizen children, em,um, but they're divided along legal status and documented citizen.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: Right, that's because the US didn't recognize a lot of the civil wars and so thus didn't assign them a category of refugees.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: So I'm gonna let everyone introduce themselves and we're gonna start with Brenda Pérez Amador and then Kumera Genet and then Ted Gong.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Perla Guerrero</i>: And I've asked them to share a little bit about themselves, who they are and a little bit about their family's migration story.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Perez</i>: Thank you! So thank you everybody for being here. My name is Brenda Perez. I'm originally from Mexico, but I've been in D.C. for pretty much half of my life.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: So I'm kind of like a Mexican Washingtonian. And right now I'm studying at the University of the District of Columbia.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: I'm doing civil engineering as my major. And I'm also a youth activist here in D.C.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: I do campaigns for language access to give quality education for English language learners in the D.C. public system and I also do a lot of campaigning towards immigration reform.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: And the main reason why I came to the United States was because there were a lot of family issues.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: Uh back in Mexico, the- we're still right now the police is very corrupt, and the government is really corrupt as well.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: So, my dad worked for the police department and he started to become so corrupt that that kind of mentality that he had in the workplace started to follow into the home.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: So he started to be very abusive, uh not very supportive financially or emotionally.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: So my mom, being the strong woman that she is, she said, "I can't live with you anymore. I have to take my children with me."

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: So we lived with my grandmother, uh for a couple of years until my mom faced another challenge where she couldn't find work.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: And ten years ago, or eleven years ago, it was really hard for women to find work in Mexico.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: Especially since she didn't have a college education and she was a single mother.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: It's very typical back in our home countries, when you go to an interview they ask you, "Are you married?" or "How many children do you have?"

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: because they kind of wanna lay your intellectuality based on your husband or something like that.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: So it was very hard for her to find a job and she decided to come to the United States because this is where the dream was. um

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: My father was here, uh, long before my gran- my mother came here so he was able to establish his space,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: a house and when my mom decided that she wanted to come he opened his house for us here in D.C.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: She came here and then two years later she decided that me and my siblings would come here as well,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.773 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Brenda Pérez</i>: because things in Mexico were not looking as good. But yeah, that's a little bit about why I came here.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Kumera Genet</i>: Alright, I am Kumera Zakarias Genet.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I'm from Austin, Texas originally. My family is from Ethiopia.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Both my parents came to the U.S in the early 1970s to mid-'70s.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My dad finished high school here in the United States.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He left Ethiopia in 1973 I believe, and

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He was a student protester at the time.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He was protesting against the government Aile Salassie.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It was a very large student protest movement, and he was put in jail twice,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And there was a very palpable fear for his life when he left, um so through the missionary services,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He was able to find a way out of the country to go to school here to finish school and then uh eventually go to college

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And then my mother came on a student visa.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So I grew up in Austin, Texas in a predominantly Mexican-immigrant and Mexican-American community

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've worked in education and youth development for 10 years.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
First starting here in D.C in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in northwest D.C.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Most of my students and the families that I've worked with were from El Salvador, but there were also large populations of students from the Dominican Republic, African-American students, Ethiopian students, and Guyanese.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So it was a wonderful neighborhood.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um it's changed a lot since when I first started working there and a lot of those families don't live there anymore.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But I've continued working in youth development, and now I'm at a national organization planning events

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and writing curricula for first-generation college students and first-generation Americans. 
[SILENCE] 
<i>Ted Gong</i>:

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, so, my name is Ted Gong.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And, uh, I was born in the United States, so I didn't come here as an immigrant,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and in fact, I'm fourth or fifth-generation Chinese-American.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My great grandfather actually came working here at things like

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He wasn't in the gold mines. He wasn't in the railroads.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
He was out there shucking potatoes on the, in San Franciso Bay

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and then my father, grandfather, and great grandfather were born here.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My mother came here after the war

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
as a bride of an American citizen.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, you know my career is a little different from these people. I'm actually a retired foreign service officer.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've been 30 years working with the state department and the U.S immigration service

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and uh, most recently I've scouted out to[?] Homeland Security and Customs Border Protection

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I've worked on the 1986-'89 reforms actually and worked on the most recent reforms

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
back before it was uh still being considered as passable before it collapsed completely

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So right now I'm in charge of a foundation.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We call it the "1882 Foundation".

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
1882 is the year in which the first comprehensive immigration act was passed.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
In the year 1882, Congress passed the law to prohibit Chinese from immigrating to the United States or becoming American citizens

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Based purely on race.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You cannot come to the United States because you were Chinese.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Ah, my mother was affected by that. I can tell that story later for you.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But anyway, we created a foundation which is called the 1882 Foundation.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I'm the executive director, and what we do is we try to educate the public about the significance of the 1882 laws.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We want to talk about Chinese-American history.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
We do this through all histories and preservations of historical sites.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh, we do workshops for teachers, curriculum reform,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
try to introduce the topic of exclusion acts into the curriculum.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And we also do annual gatherings of museums, Asian-American museums, and historical societies, and try to share best practices.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, I look forward to continuing this discussion with all of you.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Wonderful, the next question that I thought we would talk about is a little bit about the context in the country or area of origin

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Political issues, economic issues, environmental issues, um,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and if you have any ideas, um, about the relationship to the United States.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And Ted, since you just mentioned Chinese exclusion, and how your organization is trying to introduce that into curricula, I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about that

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Chinese exclusion in the United States, how Chinese immigrants were able to enter during exclusion

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and then why you think it's important for, um, school-age children to learn that history, and then we'll kind of work our way down the panel. =

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Ted Gong</i>: So there's a whole host of issues there.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Everything from the very origins of immigration law, the whole immigration bureaucracy, the way we have as sort of an antagonist relationship between the applicant and the government workers.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
All actually stems from the 1882 Act if you really wanna think about it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
In fact, not very many people know this but the mounted border patrol,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
which we think about that's patrolling the Mexican border, was actually formed to prevent Chinese

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
from trying to sneak across from Mexico into the United States to avoid the 1882 laws.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The 1882 law was passed to do two things: prevent Chinese from immigrating to the United States by their race, prevent them from becoming American citizens also by race.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That law was renewed three times. In 1882 it was passed for 10 years.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And pay attention to some of the vocabulary that is used. It was meant to be a temporary exclusion.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Expediant thing. And it was approved 10 years later in 1892.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And then it was approved again 10 years later in 1902 and made permanent.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, people talk about today about temporary visions of law they need to be a little bit of cautious of what that actually means.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The 1882 laws completely raced based was not rescinded until 1943, and in 1943 they rescind it because of uh United States was in the war with Japan and China was our ally.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So you couldn't really fight a war against fascism and say you those people that were your partners could not come to the United States.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, the question then is how do people come? And despite the laws, my father was able to come,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
different people were able to come, and we have things like people trying to pretend they were Amer-

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
you couldn't prevent Americans who people who were born in the United States bec- be American Citizens.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
In fact, actually, the the birthright citizenship was determined by a Chinese exclusion case.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
It was a case by a guy named Huang Kim Art, who was born in Modesto, California went to China,  and then came back.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And the Chinese uh immigration officials tried to exclude him because he shouldn't be-

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
he was born to immigrants of the United States who were not eligible, undocumented aliens. Right? They were undocumented people.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Right. 
<i>Ted Gong</i>: So birthright citizenship was actually determined in a Supreme Court case brought to court by a Chinese person.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
A Chinese person established the 14th Amendment was if you were born in the United States you are a citizen.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, you need to be cautious too, that I think one of the most dangerous things that our face of the United,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
immigration today is actually not totally the prohibition about people coming in [?United States] temporary but the attack on potential birthright citizenship.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So anybody is looking around right now and say we need to review that case cause the case in Supreme [?bout]

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
as a split decision actually, although for the hundred-plus years,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
everyone assumes that birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment is secure.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I think that if the Congress or other people want to pass a legislation that tests the case,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the purpose is to bring it to the Supreme Court for another decision of that.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
There is a possibility that you're going to lose birthright citizenship.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Birthright citizenship is not something that many countries in the modern world actually have,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so it's not unusual for other countries to say we don't recognize birth simply by the fact that you're born within our territories,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so we need to be careful about those things, those implications are there.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So paper sons, undocumented people we now celebrate a lot of the people that come here pretend

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that they are Americans or they had other citizenship.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My mother tried to come here when she was sixteen years old,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and she couldn't come in the United States she was held at Angel Island

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
which was an immigration detention center on San Francisco Bay.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They say it's the Ellis Island of the West,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but actually it was designed to detain and hold Chinese people to exclude them.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My mother came there in May 1937 on a ship. She came here by herself.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
She stayed there for eleven months be sure she was deported back to China.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So she couldn't get in the United States.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And uh so uh that's something to think about in what we mean by who we exclude and how we can.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
There's an immigration law I remember looking at now that says if you try the Indian United States

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
by pretending that you are American citizen then you are ineligible for life.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That's one of the provisions in our current immigration law.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But, and I thought to myself, you know if that law had been in place when my mother tried to enter

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and she tried to enter when she was trying to pretend that she was another person that was born in the United States,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
she would have been not able to come to the United States.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I would not be here. I wouldn't be here talking to you guys.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Right. Yeah. [[laughter]] {SPEAKER nme= Speaker 1}

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Anyway. That's some some background. {SPEAKER name=Speaker 1}

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yeah, thank you.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um there is a book, for those of you interested, uh um on immigration in the West,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
there is a book on Angel Island, and particularly um the way it was used to detain Asian immigrants that were trying to enter the United States,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and the other thing that Ted mentioned that I just wanted to really uh call your attention to

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
is the fact that when we talk about so-called "Anchor babies" today, children born to undocumented immigrants,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
um it was an Asian American person that was the first "Anchor baby"

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because that Supreme Court case was about whether that person was actually a U.S. citizen because he was born in the United States.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So we also need to think about the way in which ideas about race and immigration or immigrants change over time,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
how we kind of displace our anxieties about race and difference or um the economy on to different groups of people at particular times.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, Kumera, I wonder if you could share a little bit about your-do you know about your family's-

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
like your parents'-how, they got their student visas, was it easy, was it difficult,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
um do you have a sense of whether many other people had the same opportunity or

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
whether things just kind of lined up for your parents? 
<i>Kumera Genet</i>:

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.550 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh yeah. I can talk about that. Um, I don't know a lot, and I think that's common

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: The process is very complicated.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
What a lot of, I think, parents and particularly the Ethiopian community want to do,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
there is a strong feeling of protecting your child.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Like, I was born here and so it's almost like this is just another burden as a parent

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that I don't want to pass on to my child, right?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They never really wanted to get in the ins and outs of that and I found a couple of things.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
My father actually passed away earlier this year,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and so I was looking through a lot of his documents and I found like, just this big box full of INS documents and stuff like that.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Going back to the early seventies, bank ledgers of when he was sending money back to Ethiopia when he was a student in college

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And um, it's something that I think because of the, like I was saying,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the very strong need, um, for them to want their children, like myself, to assimilate

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
that there there isn't as much information shared.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I know more about my extended family who came as refugees

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Mhm.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: than I actually know about my parents.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
A lot of my families who came to this area in particular, because I grew up in Texas,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
a lot of my family members started coming to D.C. in the nineties.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And they were coming from Ethiopia by way of Kenya and Tanzania, so they were passing through Nairobi,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and then over there that's when they would get to the UNHCR Office, and so on that side of my family,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
they come from a group called the Oromo people in Ethiopia who were for people who were

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
politically involved and families who were politically involved like mine

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Number one, they had the access and the ability to leave the country and the privilege to be able to do that.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And number two, it was recognized in the East African UNHCR Policy,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the UN High Commission for Refugees that they were a targeted group

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and so in that time period it was possible for them to get refugee papers and to come directly to the United States.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Did they have to have sponsors in the U.S. as refugees?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Mhmm, they did, and there was a previous generation.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Among Ethiopians, I don't want to make quick and hard rules here but Ethiopians first started coming to the D.C. area in the fifties,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
many as students and diplomats.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
The 60s and 70s, a lot more who were from more well-to-do families came to the area.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That includes my parents' generation and my parents' standing in Ethiopia at the time.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And then in the 80s when the Civil War started going on is when more people started coming as refugees.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And then in the 90s, that continued until the 90s and 2000s when a lot of refugees and also through the diversity visa program.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Right.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So the sponsors were the more well-to-do uncles cousins

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Mhm. 
<i>Speaker 1</i>: or whoever who had made roots here earlier.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Right. So um, for those of you that don't know,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
when you are actually in a country abroad and you're actually recognized as a refugee, as a persecuted group,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the United Nations has to deem you a persecuted group.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Due to race, religion, ethnicity, that also is tied into larger issues around policy,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but once you actually are a refugee you have to then wait for a U.S. sponsor that takes financial responsibility for you and/or your family.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So in this case, aunties, uncles would say to U.S. Immigration service,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
"I will sponsor, I will take on my niece, my nephew. I am financially responsible for them until they get on their feet.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
I will enroll them in school. I will help them find a job."

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Sometimes this changes, it fluctuates.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
But one of the privileges of being a refugee, if you can call it that, even though people are fleeing war and terror and other issues is that the

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
U.S. Government does provide some services.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh classes- English-language classes, job training, possibly rent subsidies in addition to the spon- to the sponsor who takes on the

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
responsibility. This is one of the largest differences between refugees and undocumented immigrants.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Refugees have legal status, which means they can, if they can find a job, they can get a job.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Undocumented immigrants do not have a legal status in the United States,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
which means they often have to break another law to get false documentation or work under the table.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So, and they also rely on family networks that unofficially kind of sponsor them, but there's no kind of safeguard in place.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So one of the other things that Kumera said that's really important is that largely speaking,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
whether you're looking at Latin America, Cuba, Nigeria, the first cohorts,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the first and second cohorts of people fleeing political turmoil or economic crisis are the elite,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
are the wealthy people of those countries.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
For Cuba the Golden Exiles in the late fifties, 1960s were people with money.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Same thing for Nigeria. And you start to see the repercussions of this when their U.S.-born children become really successful. Right?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Those of you that are familiar with the idea of the model minority, it's like

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
"they did it, the rest of you poor people should be able to do it too".

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
A lot of the people that made it that are the children are actually children of very educated people in their countries of origin.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So they're the children of doctors or professionals in a way that a lot of undocumented children from

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Laos, from Vietnam, from Thailand, from Mexico, Guatemala are not.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Their parents are not highly educated, in addition to the immigration issues that are present.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So that's also one of the things that really structures immigration in the United States,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
is parents' educational obtainment in their country of origin,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
whether they're literate in their native language on top of any legal issues present.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Um, what do you want to tell us a little bit about?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
A little bit more about Mexico? Any kind of like, political issues?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
You touched upon the kind of corruption, anything else you want to share about the context and kind of like,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
as a push factor, right? Why people leave?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: So I think very generally, a lot of the stuff that happens here in the U.S. directly impacts Mexico.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So if the U.S. starts to have an immigration problem, then they kinda look at Mexico and they're like,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
"well, it's your people." And then Mexico will say, "O.K. I don't think it's our people

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
but it's maybe like, people coming from other countries crossing Mexico to get to your country."

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
So we see a lot of that stuff.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Uh when when the U.S. started to have a lot of youth that coming here undocumented,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and this was a couple of years ago when they were coming from Central America,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and what Mexico did in retaliation to that I guess, is that the border patrol,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
because Mexico also has a border patrol between Central America, Guatemala, and Mexico,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
is that they started to reinforce it to prevent those people from coming into Mexico

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so that Mexico kind of doesn't get blamed for these immigration issues.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Also a lot with drugs. When the U.S. needs drugs, or when they start to have a problem with drugs,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
then Mexico gets pointed at it like "oh, well it's your people again".

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And the government starts to take a lot of action into that.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
They start to do a lot of more repercussions and more stuff but again,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.450 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the corruption in Mexico is due to a lot of that stuff, people taking power, so

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Yeah, I don't really know much about Mexico. um, I only grew up there until I was 10 years old but all of that stuff is very, like, it prevails, it's so prevailing and it's a lot of stuff that is so very noticeable.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Up to this date, um, my grandmother talks about all of the Salvadorians who come into our neighbourhood because, uh, we're in the capital.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And she tells me stories about how they're also getting kicked out, how immigration is also looking for them,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: and how a lot of them have to work under the table in Mexico, and how a lot of them have very difficult issues trying to,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: uh, learn Spanish because believe it or not, a lot of the Central Americans that come in through Mexico most of them are from indigenous cultures,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: so Spanish may not necessarily be their first language.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So, it's interesting to see how we have a lot of sim- like this immigration stuff and government corruption is very similar in Mexico and here in the United States.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: It's kinda like the same girl with the different dress, you know.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Like, we still have language problems, immigration problems, there's a lot of racism, a lot of, um, language access problems and stuff like that.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Thank you. Okay, final question for the panel now, we'll take some audience questions.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Um, very quickly, is there anything else that you want the audience to know about?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: It can be about immigration, it can be about the- the personal meeting policy or your family's country of origin or area of origin,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: basically, what do you want the audience to know about that you might not get in our, you know, in very many other places? Does anybody have an idea?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: So, you know, I do want to sorta like, broaden the discussion a little bit. You know we talk about migration and we talk about immigration,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: we talk about them coming over here, uh and we try to understand the reasons for people to come.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: And I think it's very human for us to understand that these issues, whether it's government corruption, or war, or poverty, or whether- these are not things that that are just, that are alien to the United States.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: If you think about the mass migrations from the South to the North,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: that was a huge significant movement of American people because of conditions in the South and the prospects and hopes that you have when you have the big Northern migration.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: You think about the Okies and Arkies that left the big Dust Bowl period and came across Route 66.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: All the human stories and all those things, they're very understandable you don't have to go to find a foreign reason for people to come here.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: The difference, I think, in some of the things we do in immigration is that we actually set rules in a national policy,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: deciding who can come and who cannot come. So I just want to go a little bit further in this issue. One of the things we did in the 1882 foundation,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: the reason we got formed was because we organized a group nationwide to try and get Congress to apologize or acknowledge that they did wrong in the 1882 Act.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: There was nothing more- it was so fundamentally racist,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: it basically said "if you're a Chinese, you cannot come to the United States except on the- except for a couple of exceptions, and you could not become an American citizen only because you're a Chinese".

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: My- in immigration records that I saw in San Bruno from my mother, big files like that,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: the one document, the final document that said "Cause for Exclusion: Alien is a person of the Chinese race and therefore ineligible to become an American."

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: And signed by the San Francisco district director at the immigration department that time it was the department of labour.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: But the issue for us is that these things have happened in the past.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: In 1882 project, we got Congress to apologize basically for having passed those laws.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: And the question comes forth: why do we want to do that? It's something that was rescinded, happened over 130 years ago.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: Chinese Americans are almost the model minority to come up here, the laws about race aren't there anymore.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: Why do this? And the answer is the stock answer you have.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: We need to do this so that Congress can learn from its past.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: We cannot build a future we do not understand the past, we don't want to re-remo, we don't want to repeat the past mistakes.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: But I would say that there is another issue- there is a deeper way to understand that.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: I think that the criticism we got during the 1882 project was that I don't want to talk about the past, I want to talk about the future.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: Yeah, there was mistakes, but let's build forward together.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: I think you still need to pass these types of laws, whether it's an apology for slavery, or the Japanese internment, or for the roundup of the Native Americans, you have to pass it.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: And there's actually only four apologies were passed. Native Americans, internment, something about slavery, something about the Native Americans and the Chinese Americans.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: The issue there, not that we are trying to apologize, single out the past and single out the victims of past laws so that we don't repeat it for the next decade.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: The next- whether that's the Sikh Americans, the Filipino Americans, the Japanese internment or the Mexican Americans today, or Muslims.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: The reason you pass it is because you have Congress, and we got Congress to pass these legislations by unanimous vote and the Senate and the House.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: Two separate actions unanimously. It's quite remarkable at the time where people don't even talk to each other.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: And the reason you pass it because you made the issue was not an immigration issue. The issue was a civil rights issue.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:08.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: And what does it mean to be an American? And what- by passing these type of laws you force Congress, who represents all the Americans,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: and has to respond to the constituents and say we need to spend time in Congress to pass these laws because by passing them you- or these apologies,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: you use a standard that says, "I reaffirm our founding principles (the 14th Amendment)." That reaffirmation is for all Americans.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: It's not just for the victims of that period. So, it is a very forward-looking policy.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: You saying that we might've forgot it sometime but here in 2011 and 2012, we reaffirm the Constitution and our founding principles.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: That's for all of us that affects all Americans. But I would say that that kind of apology goes one step further.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: You can- you apologize for being American, but if I ask you guys, or you, or these people if- do you know what your past is?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: If you don't know what your past is what your history was if you are denied that history, if you don't know about these laws, a portion of you is missing.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:22.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: Right? You're allowing someone else to tell you what is important in the history that made you, and you and you.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: That is a civil right, that's a civil rights issue.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: I should know, I should know my history I should be allowed to hear my history.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: The school should not exclude it whether they do it purposely or our societies and our communities should not do it because they're just ignorant.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: They just don't know. We need to tell the people, and it should be us to tell it. We need to tell it in our own words.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: So we can say that not somebody else is telling me what I am and who I am. I will tell myself and I will make the decision what is important to me, and to do that we have to know our history.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 3</i>: We have to confront our history. Right? So, that's what- that's a sort of thought.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Thank you. Other comments?

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:15.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Yeah um- just three things. Um, migration and immigration are not an easy subject.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And that said uh we need to educate ourselves we need to educate ourselves and knowing that there is no line that immigrants can go to.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And just apply for citizenship status. It's not like that. It's very complicated.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And get ourselves educated in all of the programs that the U.S. implements for immigrants, for undocumented folk, for refugees and how they work.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And that each time they implement something that it's not necessarily a victory because like we learned from the refugee program it only benefits the elite and when it comes to undocumented folk there's a program that is called DACA which it gives,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: uh, a work permit and a social security number for undocumented youth.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:18.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: That came without them knowing that they were coming into the United States. But still those programs don't benefit the large population of undocumented folk and the it doesn't fix the refugee problems that we have.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: So they're temporary? DACA is temporary?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And DACA is very temporary. It's only for two years and every time it expires you have to reapply and you have to pay a lot of money to get that kind of documentation back.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So, it doesn't benefit anybody.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:48.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And in order to get yourself educated again or my last- the last uh piece of advice that I had for you guys, is to get more involved in the community work with local non-profits that are doing this work.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:01.010 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Talk to folk who are affected by these issues and try to see how you can get involved. If it's financially, if it's helping them with any resources or any kind of information that you may have. So, yeah.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Okay, um. It's kind of a hard question. um, there's a couple of things.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: One thing I want to point out is that both immigration, refugee policy, the push factors, we are still recovering from a lot of the pain and suffering of the Cold War throughout the world.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: My family, the Civil War in Ethiopia was part of the Cold War for Salvadorians, Nicaraguans.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: It's not that these conflicts wouldn't have happened, but would they have been sustained to such a level with so many arms and these kind of things escalating and pushing hundreds of thousands of millions of people out of multiple countries.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:04.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: It, it would not have been at this level And that's a direct part of the vestiges of U.S. foreign policy and Russian foreign policy and other actors.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And so that stuff doesn't go away. I went to Ethiopia for the first time in 1994.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: That was 2 years after the war ended, and you could still see the impact of that in so many places.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: You could still see um, you know, bullet holes in the, it was just like,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:40.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: so, I empathize so much, particularly with Central Americans in part with my experience working with that community here in DC and also because I know what it feels like, I know what it's like for that to be your family, um, and so we have to very much keep that in mind.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Um, both in what we advocate for in immigration policy but also how foreign policy will end up impacting immigration policy in the future. The other point is,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: I just want to explicitly say this, immigration issues are black issues also.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: I'm black and my parents always raised me to be very, like, thankful and grateful for the sacrifices that a lot of communities made.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:23.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: I'm learning about the history of organizing that the Chinese American community has done and also for the black community that's helped open the doors for us to come here as immigrants after the 1960s.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: And um, in any part of the immigration discussion, there are black issues.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: In the travel ban that affected Sudan and Somalia, also, those are black countries and so that visibility isn't always acknowledged when folks are talking about immigration and that needs to be acknowledged and explicitly states also.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: That also related to policing. I grew up in a black and brown community, so that extends where the criminal justice system is often a mechanism for putting predominantly young man into immigration detention and other things for very minor offences, like in Brooklyn jumping a turnstile on the subway.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: So we have to also make sure that we keep that in mind and be inclusive and continue to frame immigrants for who and what we are.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Right, on that note, for those of you who don't know, undocumented black immigrants are disproportionately deported in relationship to other immigrants and the reason for that is because they are stopped more frequently by the police for jumping the turnstile,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: and thus their intersection with racial profiling in the United States and their immigration status leads them to be disproportionately deported.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:06.140 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: So this is a very kind of crystal-clear intersection of race and immigration status. Okay, um, a couple, does anybody have questions? Anything you want to know about? Yes.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[SILENCE] =

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:10.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: So the question is, how? How- maybe what does it look like, the intersection of the black community with immigration issues? Since, when we talk about immigration, it's often as if we are excluding black people. So what is the question [??]

00:44:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Uh, okay. Well, I think part of how you do it is, is, what- number one, be inclusive, having people like me on discussions like this. I think it's something that's largely, in my opinion, from outside of the black immigrant community and black communities. I think if I'm walking down the street, I grew up here in the United States, I'm very happy and I am, I identify as black, as do my parents and my family. I think that that not acknowledging black immigrants as immigrants is- how do I put it? Like, I grew up where I grew up as a housing discrimination, not necessarily because of anti-immigrant discrimination, but because in Austin it was very difficult for black families to get a home West of the highway. So I think, and I do work at an immigrant civil rights organization and uh, or a Latino civil rights organization that's very involved in immigration issues. when we talk about some of the things that I was saying, policing in communities, housing discrimination, quality education, I think it's, to be honest, more incumbent on the immigrants rights organizations to make sure they're inclusive of that? And then I would also- yeah I think it's more- I think it's more on the communities that are doing immigrants organizing to be sure to be inclusive of that, to talk about that then it is particularly on us to be visible. I always say I'm a first-generation American. I'm Black.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:28.350 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: So there's an assumption in the question. That there are people who are immigrants coming in and there's the white group of people. It is how you would define what is American, right? So you need to look at that assumption first. And in immigration policy and how you [??] that in actually separate is another issue.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Ok, unfortunately, we're out of time, if- I know we're out of time, I'm sorry. If you have a burning question, we're going to be off to the side, you can come and approach us, we'll be happy to talk to you for a few minutes. Thank you so much for joining us, stay tuned for the next panel. You were supposed to put that
