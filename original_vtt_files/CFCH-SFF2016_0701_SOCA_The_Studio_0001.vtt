<i>Chelis Lopez</i>: (Translation) Since the national trip from the city of Washington, Radio Bilingue presents a coverage of a special collection of sounds from the state of California. A special program that forms part of the festival of Folklore of the Smithsonian of this year. This production is a collaboration with the Alliance for California Traditional Arts and the "Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage" from the Smithsonian.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:35.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Chelis Lopez</i>: During the next hour, we will start with two impressive figures of Afghan music. Exile and destiny have brought them to find themselves in the United States; specifically in California. This year, 2016, the festival offers diverse cultures that were unified by immigration, by the movement, and the finding for belonging. Sounds of California and Basco is the two programs of this festival.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

Homayonn was born in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. And is a teacher of Rubab, the national instrument of Afghanistan. Both of them know not only their instruments, they know how to make them converse in unison.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Chelis Lopez</i>: Successfully perfoming an amazing mix of the folkore of Afghanistan, with classical sounds of the North of India, and, as we heard at the concert yesterday, also the sounds of California and the United States are present.

<i>Speaker 1</i>: Sorry you're right I do this all the time.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Sorry

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: When you got to California, sorry I'll get this right eventually, when you got to California was there Afghanistan music in California?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Actually, yes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: There's a lot of Afghani people from like and and I think 40,000 yea And, also my friends they were there. And that's why. And the weather. [spanish]. It was a it was a very nice climate, but I should add to that because there are many vocalists, composers, singers, songwriters who fled in the late seventies and ended up in Fremont, California or New York or Virginia. So it was kind of a reconnection of sorts with with different artists. And that's kinda how I grew up playing in in I grew up playing in house parties, Afghan house parities. Like I was 5, 6, 7 years old and that was my first experience with Afghan music because there was no like international festival presenting Afghan traditional music and that's where I got my feet wet initially. And that's actually how [[??]] and I first met you know the [[??]] style. [spanish]

00:13:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Can you speak about the [[??]] a little bit. And she understands there might be two pieces to this [[??]] fill people in a bit. Sure. So the tabla is a principle accompanying instrument of Afghan music, Indian music, Pakistani music and the tabla has its own language so every syllable that's played, every stroke that's played on the tabla, has a corresponding note. So on my left hand, you have and on the right hand you have So together, combined. Then you have compositions like fixed compositions, compositions we practiced, compositions that my ustad my [[??]] gave to me. So the style of [[??]] I learned was from Panjab Panjab School of Tabla which is also prevalent in Afghanistan. Ustad Hashem and his whole family also follow Punjab style. So it's really interesting, this fusion of styles of tabla.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
[Spanish]

00:15:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
One more thing I would like to add to that is that to play with [[??]] it's very special because you have to listen to a lot of [[??]] and [[??]] music is very very diverse; many styles, so many styles. And [[??]] plays all the styles. Like any province, he can just go all night for you. Like from one city to the next city to the next city, right? [laughter] [spanish]

00:17:02.000 --> 00:22:02.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Yea so can you tell us a little bit about the [[??]], which is known as the national instrument of Afghanistan. It is national instrument. [mumbling] Mhm yes, yes [[??]] yes, cierto. Can you tell us a little bit about the instrument, how it's played or how it's put together, what it looks like. So people on the radio might be able to imagine. Ok uh 
<i>unknown</i>: [[Afghani]] {SPEAKER name= "Homayonn Sakhi"} The rabab is made out of mulberry tree branch or root [[language?]] And it's 3 pieces of wood. So you have the body, the neck, and the chest. [spanish] It's like a fred board. [spanish] And also skin instrument, skin is the reason goat skin the goat skin. [spanish] And also have 3 main string and 2 [[??]], and 15 [[??]] strings. Tiene doce 2, 3, and 15. 3 main string? Si, [[??]]. 2 [[??]] we call [[??]] like king strings. [spanish] And 15 [[??]] strings. [spanish] {SPEAKER name= Speaker Unknown} Ah la musica. The music from Afghanistan is specifically what you do two instruments together, or is this something you you have really elevated to your style. {SPEAKER name= Homayonn Sakhi} Actually we a lot of different we have mahali, we call [[??]] and that's like 4 people that are playing together. Mahali is the name of the group. Mahali is the name of the style. So Mahal like for the people music for the people. And that's usually 4 piece ensemble. [Spanish] And also we have a different instrument like like tambor, [[??]], [[??]], [[??]], this is [[??]]. [Spanish] [[??]] which literally means underarm drum. [Spanish] [Spanish] This might be kind of a silly question, but do you have to play sitting down? So yea traditionally these instruments are played, most comfortable sitting down. Like [[??]] has made a robab that he can play standing up. But, thats [[??]]. That's [[??]]. [Laughter] [Spanish] [Laughter] Actually because because I start I was 10 years old, but that time people they said like you know what, this is like this is not for like young people this instrument. But this instrument is for like you know for older people. And that's why I said like you know what I have to play for young generation. [Spanish]

00:22:02.000 --> 00:23:26.500 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
And OK and also, I have like I have like right now I have more than like 16 students. They are all young. They are just like 15, 14, 18, 16. 
<i>Speaker 1</i>: 16 {SPEAKER name=Homayonn Sakhi} more than 16 years. More than 16, yea. [spanish] [spanish] Ok, in short, you mentioned how there is sometime perception of age difference. What were you doing, are you doing anything special to involve young people in this music? For example, do you ever put any English words or any any other musical influences into your music to attract young to appeal to young people? [Afghani] Actually

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
Some songs like like new songs I was playing that time. Eh that was like people they're saying like. this was not coming like this is people was not playing on their [[bob?]]. And that I was playing that songs for young people.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

(speaker 3) *women speaking Spanish* [00:25;06] (speaker 2) So uh we're in this program in the Folklight Festival this year; sounds of California and so the question the basic question is you've collaborated [[?]] quartet for example a very successful collaboration, and in the ambience of California, have you worked into; how have you embraced the sounds of California you hear around you in your music at all? Have you involved that in you music?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: *inaudible sounds*

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 2</i>: so uh yes California has had an influence on our music, um we play a song called Hotel California.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

<i>Speaker 2</i>: I should say all jokes apart that what's really important although we're living in California and we're embracing and assimilating is we're hanging on to our roots, and our culture. California is gonna benefit from having [[Robov]] rather than the [[Robov]] player start playing all California tunes I think.

are living in right now

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
cause he's in the north, I'm in the south,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and we have completely committed ourselves 150% to keep

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
the music original, authentic,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
so that the next Afghan generation that is born

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
connection to their roots, because we cannot lose that.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
That's the last thing we have

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
and it's very, very important,

<i>Speaker 1</i>: Pero ellos practican su espiritualidad, su comida, su su su vida familiar, y todas las tradiciones. O sea viven la vida de ser Afghanistani en California.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white

<i>Salar Nader</i>: And I just want to add one more thing. Is that Homayoun, you go back to Afghanistan right? Like 2, 3 times a year?

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Homayoun Sakhi</i>: Yes, uh huh.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Yeah. So no matter what's happening or what you see in the media that's happening in Afghanistan on a daily basis.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: We actually still go back. We go back together. We're actually planning on going back in October and we teach music there.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:55.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Homayoun's 60 students that he's mentioning, I just wanna kind of add this, those are 60 professional recording concert-playing musicians.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: That's not to mention the hundreds of others that are just studying. Right?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Homayoun Sakhi</i>: [[incohenerent]]

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:09.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Y ellos-- este-- estaban diciendo que primeramente los estudiantes, los 60 estudiantes, que menciono Homayoun.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Son al nivel profesional y ademas hay como centenares de otros estudiantes.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:21.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Y a pesar de lo que se-- se da cuentos, se oyen en los medios, en la television, en lo que sea

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Ellos si regresan a su-- a Afghanistan para enseñar, para dar classes y para tocar.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Para mantener contacto con su cultura

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Crowd</i>: [[cross talk]]

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 5</i>: Do you like track and field?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: I love track and field.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 5</i>: Yeah, uh-- I was wondering if in Afghanistan is there track and field?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: The Afghanistan track and field-- track and field by itself-- olympics was [[support to our wish?]]. They love it.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:12.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: La pregunta es, si en Afghanistan les gusta track and field, o sea el deporte olímpico. Y dice que les encanta. Y sí, se pratica

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:24.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: You know, I should also mention that Homayoun, growing up in his teenage years-- He's told me while we're on tour or traveling, you know, you're on the road with each other for a month in each other's face everyday on stage.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: So it's like new stories, what are we gonna talk about. And at one time Homayoun liked Martial Arts.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:37.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Like uh-- Bruce Lee. Taekwondo... [Laughter] I mean, no, really. Seriously. So watch out, don't [laughter]... Be careful!

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Chelis Lopez</i>: Tenemos tiempo para una pregunta más aqui, por favor.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 6</i>: How do you promote Afghan music in America? How do you keep it alive? I heard you talking about growing up with house parties.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Right.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 6</i>: And I suspect there's some attraction in festivals.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Right.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 6</i>: But does it play well in clubs? In American club style settings? How do you promote it?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:19.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Yeah, it's really tough. It's really really tough and we, this is something we deal with on a daily basis. We're living in the time of Justin Bieber and like boy bands and that's never gonna go away.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:27.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: So we're in this tiny little slither of world music and we're like a sub genre of a sub genre of a sub genre of world music.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:41.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Afghan music? Like, a lot of people don't even know that we exist actually. Uh, you know, post 9/11 people thought Afghan music - since it was banned - had no idea that there was actually a history of Afghan music.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:51.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: And that goes back a couple of thousand years. To Sufi chanting, Qawwali Farsi music for [?] spiritual. That's what it was.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:03.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: So, night clubs. We don't -- We never say no because the integrity of the instrument is such a pure and spiritual instrument that -- you know, if you have kind of like--

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:13.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: People taking shots of tequila and having beer while they're performing it's just not a great feeling because the instruments are supposed to make you feel intoxicated.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Are supposed to heal you and-- and have those medicinal qualities in the instrument

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: I mean you just listen to the rubab in the morning, you just listen to it, it will really make your day.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: I promise you, you listen to 15, 20 minutes of rubab you will be healed.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:52.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Homayoun Sakhi</i>: And also I want to tell you, uh like sometime you know, I was feeling sick and I we nt on stage. Like I'm not feeling anything, just like I'm playing that certain -- At that time it's just I wanna play and I want to feel my music. And that's it.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: Right.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:16.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Speaker 1</i>: La pregunta era 
<i>Salar Nader</i>: But to maintain for support and whatnot, I mean we're open to playing outdoor, indoor, you name it. But we need the help of all the, any presenter, any label that's out there that's listening to this, I mean we're more than willing to get this music out there, we have to. We have to. So we need the help and support

00:54:16.000 --> 00:55:06.000 line:13 position:0% align:left size:100% background:black color:white
<i>Salar Nader</i>: La pregunta era como se promeve a parte de las festivales y los clubes, como promeve la musica de Afghanistan, la musica de ellos aqui en la sociedad y en breve, dice que si estan abiertos tocar en clubes, que dice Homayoun que lo que importa es llegar, sentir su musica, y tocar. La situacion, que sea. Dice Salar que este, ellos estan abiertos tocar pero a veces si la gente esta bebiendo por ejemplo, cerveza, le da un poco de pena porque la musica es lo que, es lo que emborracha la gente digamos, en la tradicion de ellos y no se necesita cerveza y nada como emborracharse. Pero estan abiertos tocar en cualquier situacion. Estan abiertos a grabar con cualquier sello de discos. Estan abiertos a cualquier posibilidad.
