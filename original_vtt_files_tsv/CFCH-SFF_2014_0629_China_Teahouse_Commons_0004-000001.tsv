1.0	6.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Hello, hello everyone we're getting set up for our next session in Teahouse Commons.
6.0	10.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: You are in the China Program of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.
10.0	24.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: This program is presented through a collaboration by the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian with the China International Cultural Association, working with the China Arts and Entertainment Group in Beijing.
24.0	30.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Thanks a lot for being here. Today I don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different today.
30.0	37.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: The China Festival program actually brought over 120 artists and presenters from China to participate in this program.
37.0	41.0	"<i>Speaker 1</i>: But today we are doing something a little bit different, we're calling it ""Diaspora Day""."
41.0	55.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: There are about 4 million people of Chinese ancestry in the United States, and today we're celebrating the way in which when people move, how they transform and adapt culture, community, and traditions to the new places where they end up.
55.0	65.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: So today this session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is apart of the Diaspora Day programming, which is also co-produced with the Smithsonian Asian-Pacific American Center.
65.0	81.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: So we have um today's session right now that that we're getting ready to start is the 1882 Foundation Talk Story on the Mall, and we are going to be talking about Chinatown today, Chinatown Today is the subject of this session.
81.0	90.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: And I'm going to go ahead and introduce to you Stan Liu, who is going to do the presenting and moderating of this session with our experts here today, our local experts.
90.0	96.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: I want to first introduce you to Stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 Foundation.
96.0	97.0	[SILENCE]
97.0	108.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: So Stan Liu, sitting right here to my left, is a retired civil engineer.  He used to work for the Federal Aviation Administration, and he went to China for the first time in 2003.
108.0	119.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: 2003, he spent two years there teaching Chinese at a university, and when he came back to the US he became very interested and committed with working with Chinese American organizations.
119.0	135.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Stan is himself a native of Greenville, Mississippi, which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic, um, but Stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of Chinese Americans, as well as the 1882 foundation.
135.0	149.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: and for those of you who don't know, the 1882 Foundation is a non-partisan, non-profit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of Chinese exclusion laws,
149.0	161.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep Chinese immigrants out of the United States and prevent those who were here already from ever attaining citizenship.
161.0	169.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: So they have been doing really wonderful work around the country um and I'm now going to turn it over to Stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel.
169.0	170.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: ok, thank you Sojin,
170.0	171.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: hey!
171.0	183.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: it's a pleasure for us to be here on the Mall doing our Talk Story on the Mall and uh we're-and this is Diaspora Day, like Sojin was saying here, and we're gonna, I'm gonna introduce everybody here
183.0	193.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and we're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are 'cause I don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over credentials that really don't matter.
193.0	195.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: You know, what we say is what's gonna be important.
195.0	196.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: So 
[SILENCE]"
196.0	204.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: So this is Diaspora Day and you know, and you know, the epitome of diasporas in the United States of course are Chinatowns,
204.0	210.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and that's what we think about when when we talk about displaced Chinese away from China in the United States,
210.0	213.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: Chinatowns are the first things that come to my mind,
213.0	221.0	and so when we put out our flyer, you know we said that-that, uhh, we're gonna talk about Chinatown today,
221.0	224.0	and uh, but this is not gonna to be a travelogue, by any means.
224.0	234.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: we're gonna talk about what Chinatown means to us, and uh, because like we said in the flyer, Chinatown has different meanings to different people,
234.0	241.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and one of the references I have is this book called ùòàùòÆùò¶ùò≥ùò™ùò§ùò¢ùòØ ùòäùò©ùò™ùòØùò¢ùòµùò∞ùò∏ùòØùò¥ written by Bonnie Tsui;
241.0	247.0	and so I'll just read briefly what she says about, you know, Chinatown USA.
247.0	255.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: ""a state of mind, a world within a world, a neighbourhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine, every day"
255.0	257.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: 
[SILENCE]"
257.0	261.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: ""Americans find something different in Chinatown."""
261.0	266.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: ""Its a place as foreign, yet familiar, by now quite well known on the Western-cultural radar,"
266.0	275.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: but splitting the difference still gives many visitors to Chinatown the sense above all, that things are not
275.0	276.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: 
[SILENCE]"
276.0	290.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: ""what they seem, and [uhh] popular cultural's been telling us this for decades, and it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm."""
290.0	297.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: ""A place with its own deeply felt history and stories of national-cultural significance."""
297.0	307.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: So, you know, our panel today is going to talk about, you know, what this means to the APA community, uhh, Chinese-American community from our viewpoint,
307.0	317.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and then we don't, we won't agree on everything, 'cause, as you, as those of you who are, uhh, Chinese Americans or Chinese, know that, y'know, there's very,
317.0	318.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: we argue a lot.
318.0	331.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: So we have differences of opinion about what Chinatown means to us and we have, and certainly the three panellists here all, we all, have our own opinions about it, and uh,
331.0	336.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: But one thing that, you know, and I also want you and the audience to be thinking about it too, ""what does Chinatown mean to you?"""
336.0	343.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and you know, that's gonna be your take away for today Is come out of this session here, real uh, thinking about what Chinatown means
343.0	354.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: when you go, about, if you're here in the DC area, go to DC Chinatown, and say you know, what does it mean, to you, and you know, what-and-and, cause it's changing every day.
354.0	361.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: Chinatowns, and so are those of you from out of town, go back to your hometowns and look at these Chinatowns there, and what do they mean to you?
361.0	374.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: That's-that's your assignment from-coming from the day, but, so our, our group here, one thing we have in common I think, is-is that we, we all are all, ABCs.
374.0	376.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: That's American Born Chinese.
376.0	386.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: So you know, we, uh, have that perspective that-that, we aren't, we-we're born in this country so we are Americans, but we're also, but we're really, definitely Chinese Americans.
386.0	396.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: We're all active in the DC Chinatown, and we do participate in our talk story events that we have, in Chinatown, every month.
396.0	403.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: Where we gather the community together to-to share stories of our experiences as growing up as Chinese Americans, Asian Americans,
403.0	410.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: you know and what that means, in and you know, we have this monthly in Chinatown and so if you want,
410.0	418.0	if you're interested, if you're in the area, you know, talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are going to be.
418.0	432.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: But for today, it's Chinatown, I-I, it's-it's, Talk Story on the Mall, and so I'm gonna, the way we're gonna introduce each, ourselves, is-I'm gonna go down here and ask the question, you know,
432.0	434.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: ""what does Chinatown mean to you"","
434.0	435.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: 
[SILENCE]"
435.0	437.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: and ""how is it important to you?"""
437.0	443.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and then, you know, tell us who you are, you know, and what's your relationship is, and then, and then uh, tell us
443.0	444.0	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: 
[SILENCE]"
444.0	451.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: you want to start, Shirly Wu, uh, is-is involved, so tell us about who you are, and what, and answer the questions.
451.0	452.366	"<i>Speaker 2</i>: 
[SILENCE]"
455.0	467.0	<i>Shirley Wu</i>: Ah yeah. My name is Shirley Wu, actually I was born in Washington, D.C., and my involvement in Chinatown is because I'm the director of the Chinatown Service Center, which is part of the Chinese Community Church --
467.0	470.0	the only Chinese Community Church in Washington D.C., we like to say!
470.0	484.0	And actually the reason I'm here is because, another lady, wasn't able to make it, and she really was born and worked in Chinatown for many years, and she had one of the first stores in Chinatown that's still in existence today.
484.0	498.0	Anyway, I'm here to, to be part of this panel, and to tell you that Chinatown is very meaningful to me, even though I was born in D.C., and then my parents used to come to Chinatown when we were quite young,
498.0	514.0	and at that time it was a lot different, it was a lot smaller, lot quieter, and it was a way for people to meet people like themselves that speak their languages, to have a cup of tea, to go over all news about what was happening in China, what was going on in America.
514.0	529.0	And I think it's important to me because it is a community, even though we think of it as maybe just a place people come to eat or as a touristy place, but there are real residents that live there, and it's important, I think, to maintain that.
529.0	547.0	<i>Walter Wu</i>: Thank you Shirley. My name is Walter Wu, I'm Shirley's husband,[[laughs]] and I also help at the Chinatown Service Center, which is a part of the Chinese Community Church, which is located in the heart of Chinatown, it's, that's where we worship.
547.0	559.0	I am an A.B.C, an American Born Chinese. I was born in Texas, a transplant here in 1972, and in San Antonio, we didn't have a Chinatown.
559.0	576.0	And I think for that reason I have a special appreciation, if not a greater appreciation of Chinatown. Even though the one in D.C., it's quite small, as compared, let's say, to the ones in New York or San Francisco or Los Angeles.
576.0	585.0	We tutor immigrants with their, help them improve their English; on Saturday mornings, we have a program, and we also help them with their citizenship,
585.0	607.0	and we know how valuable that the residents find living in Chinatown is. You know, we, you may go to Chinatown, it, it may have shrunk in terms of the commercial Chinatown, in terms of the number of restaurants, but I think you will see, you'll find a significant number of Chinese that live there. They live in,
607.0	614.0	mainly in three public housing projects located not that far from the heart of Chinatown.
614.0	636.0	So I think the, when we help not just ourselves, but we have others too, we have one of our tutors, actually, who's here, who's been a long-time tutor at our Saturday program, and I think the reward that we get is that when we help immigrants improve their English or help them in some way, we can see the smile on their face, we can see the appreciation,
636.0	656.052	and we can see the gratitude that they have. And Chinatown, what it is, it's, it provides an instant community for the Chinese to do fellowship with other Chinese and with similar language, so it's really, a, a very key part in helping assimilate into this country.
660.0	666.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Um So my name's Ted Gong. I'm from California and, everybody's using these terms 'A.B.C'
666.0	677.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: and I'm 'A.B.C.' and American-Born Chinese, but as you guys all know probably, there's always, like, 'H.I.P.' - Hong Kong Instant Product, M.I.T -- Made in Taiwan, all that kind of stuff like this!
677.0	684.0	But, A.B.C.-- when I s--I was--I'm about a fourth or fifth-generation Chinese from California, from Fresno.
684.0	687.0	Anybody from Fresno? Anybody know Fresno? [[laughs]]
687.0	694.0	Anyway, Rural Fresno. And we of course didn't have a Chinatown there,
694.0	701.0	and the Chinatown that we always go to is either San Francisco, primarily, or to Los Angeles.
701.0	711.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: And, you know? The thing about growing up in rural California is, I think there's probably like one or two other Chinese families in my town;
711.0	713.0	mostly we pick--
713.0	715.0	I was just talking with someone about picking gr--
715.0	720.0	--cotton, you know, and the long cotton bags and you dragged the cotton bags and doing things like this.
720.0	730.0	But you would always -- my Mom and Dad ran a grocery store--a little tiny grocery store in Orosi, California, near Dinuba California, which is near Fresno.
730.0	733.0	But we would always have these things where Mom and Dad would always say,
733.0	744.0	'We've gotta go to Taifu, Taifu, San Francisco Chinatown. You have to go back to buy the groceries, to get to talk to the
744.0	748.0	family folk, to have the banquets, to have the weddings, and so forth.
748.0	755.0	So Chinatown has that meaning as well. It is a place in which you rejuvenate in many levels.
755.0	759.0	One, to get the groceries that you can't get in rural California.
759.0	768.0	To get the food, the banquet, that familiar taste. To talk with those relatives, to have those banquets and those meals, and so forth.
768.0	775.0	Chinatown, historically, and this D.C. China[[town]] has had that same purpose,
775.0	783.0	has changed over--originally a place for immigrants to come--still is a place for immigrants to come;
783.0	791.0	to get the skills, the language, get used to the America, America, so that they can go off and do better things.
791.0	795.0	Before, Chinatown has other purposes.
795.0	801.0	During the Exclusion Act -- we talk about the 1882 Exclusion Act -- Chinatowns were actually a protective place.
801.0	814.0	You know, in 1882, 1800s and so forth if you were Chinese in a rural part of California during the time when the Chinese Exclusion Acts was going on,
814.0	821.0	the expulsion period, you could be killed, you know? And Chinatown was a protective enclave.
821.0	825.0	That is the place where Chinatowns gather together and protect themselves.
825.0	831.0	In California, just to let you know, after the Exclusion Acts,
831.0	838.0	and the period which they call the expulsion period, there were officially 200 round-ups of Chinese,
838.0	847.0	rural Chinese, kicked out of the areas, or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge Chinese from the districts.
847.0	850.0	So China[[towns]] functioned as a place, a protective place.
850.0	861.0	Later on, it becomes a place where immigrants get skills. Later on, it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the community, like in D.C. here.
861.0	864.0	The original D.C. Chinatown here,
864.0	867.0	does anybody know where the original D.C. Chinatown was?
867.0	879.0	It's at Federal Triangle! The original Chinatown was the Federal Triangle, and it's expand--it was then pushed off to where it is now and it's now constricted to where it is. So it continues to evolve.
879.0	882.0	But there's something about Chinatown that is different.
882.0	890.0	There is a sense that Chinatown is a place where you can get identity. It's linked with Chinese-American identity,
890.0	900.0	it's linked with our culture, it's linked with a desire to go back, like myself, to find those things which make up our culture and our identity.
900.0	903.0	Chinatown can be a concept as well as a place.
903.0	913.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: Very good. Very good. So yeah, I think that all three of you, what you said is is, you know, right on, you know, it's different, there's different views of what Chinatown is,
913.0	922.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and again I'm going to quote from this book here, because I think it has some great quotes in it, here. 'The truth is that Chinatown is a space of self-invention.
922.0	931.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: The oldest Chinese immigrants, including, but not limited to, those who landed in the port cities of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu,
931.0	935.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large.
935.0	950.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: These days, new immigrants continue to come for a new life, and a search for --and a search for a cultural identity, brings Chinese-Americans of many generations back to walk alongside them.'
950.0	955.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: And I guess, you know, I kinda follow in that latter category about looking for my self-identity,
955.0	961.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: because, you know, what Chinatown means to me is, you know, I feel good there, for some reason.
961.0	969.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: You know, I can't explain it because, you know, my upbringing was such that I grew up in Mississippi,
969.0	975.0	like Sojin said, during the '40s and '50s, during extremely a bad time there,
975.0	986.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: where I --it it was just not fun being Chinese! You know, we were picked on, we were abused, and we couldn't go to schools with anybody else, where they had to build a one-room schoolhouse
986.0	996.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: for us where we had all of our--all the families in the city of Greenville in one schoolhouse that housed all 12 grades with one teacher.
996.0	1003.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: So, you know, for--that was kind of the life I was brought up with, and so I said, hey it's no fun being Chinese,
1003.0	1010.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: I'm not going to be Chinese. So I, I, you know I literally rejected my heritage, ran away from it, you know, tried to forget who I was,
1010.0	1016.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: and--and so my long journey back--so I'm on this journey of self-discovery now,
1016.0	1024.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: 'cause I--I think I've come back, you know, I'm proud to be Chinese-American now, and it's part of--Chinatown's a part of my--
1024.0	1037.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: helped me in finding my self-identity. And that's--I think that's a very key part of why we're espousing what--the importance of Chinatowns, here. For me,
1037.0	1046.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: it's a personal journey, I think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community and--so--I would like to ask, you know, Walter and Shirley,
1046.0	1053.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: you know, as you grew up, you know, maybe your growing up wasn't as drastic as mine, [[laughs]]
1053.0	1069.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: I don't know--you know, I didn't handle it well, I mean you probably handled it better than I did, but, you know, so how did that influence how you you review Chinatowns now and, you know, why is it mean--your growing up--even though you didn't grow up in a Chinatown?
1069.0	1068.11	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Ah--
1076.0	1077.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: [[Shirley Woo]] It's not as drastic as that! Ah, yeah I grew up in D.C. um
1077.0	1084.0	Actually, ah, we had a laundry in South East, near--just over the bridge, Pennsylvania Avenue.
1084.0	1093.0	And at that time, in the schools I went to, elementary and even middle school, there weren't that many Asians, so of course I always stood out [[laughs]].
1093.0	1099.0	There would be, like, maybe one other girl who might be Chinese, and then she moved away and I'd be only Asian person there.
1099.0	1105.0	And my friends were always be amazed at the beginning of school year how teachers would always remember my name!
1105.0	1110.0	But of course, you know, I was the only person who was Asian, who you know, had black hair, black eyes, or whatever.
1110.0	1117.0	So I was always, am aware that I'm Chinese, I'm different from my Caucasian friends, even though,
1117.0	1120.0	they probably didn't look at me that way, which was good!
1120.0	1124.0	But I always knew that I was different, you know. My food was different at home.
1124.0	1129.0	I didn't eat sandwiches like they did and, you know, we always had rice at lunchtime, you know.
1129.0	1132.0	It was just different, you know. I had to stay in,
1132.0	1136.0	and, you know, we had a laundry, and you know, and their parents live in a house!
1136.0	1143.0	And so my dream was, some day that I was gonna have a house too, and be like that Dick and Jane book,
1143.0	1148.0	and have a dog and a cat, and Daddy would go to work and Mommy would stay home! [[laughs]]
1148.0	1155.0	But anyway, we do have a house, so I did live-- be able to live this American dream.
1155.0	1158.0	But yeah, I'm always aware that I'm Chinese.
1158.0	1168.0	And Chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to meet their friends, again, you know, to talk, to meet people of their same languages.
1168.0	1171.0	That's always important for everybody.
1171.0	1174.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: [[Walter Woo]] Well, my background was entirely different.
1174.0	1182.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: I grew up in Texas, actually I was born in San Antonio, where the major population is Hispanic,
1182.0	1184.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: so there really weren't that many Chinese there.
1184.0	1196.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: And, so it--we did--what Chinese food we ate was from my mother's cooking at home, basically [[laughs]]. You know, so we didn't have a Chinatown,
1196.0	1203.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: or anything like that. We'd visit relatives who were Chinese, and so forth, and that was about the extent of the Chinese population.
1203.0	1211.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: So when I came to Washington D.C. to work in 1972, ended up staying because I met my wife here,
1211.0	1219.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: but I remember when I visited New York City for the first time during Chinese New Year,
1219.0	1227.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: I was just so mesmerized by the number of Chinese in New York Chinatown.
1227.0	1237.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: I mean, to me, it was so impressive to see so many Chinese there. I--I--I was thrilled to death, really.
1237.0	1239.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: I never experienced something like that.
1239.0	1250.0	So it--it--it's great, really. It's, it's a great thrill, you know, to be among other Chinese and to see--going to a Chinatown
1250.0	1256.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth, and they all were so thriving, really.
1256.0	1268.0	So it really was an eye-opening experience for me, and it's something that I always will appreciate and even though the D.C. Chinatown is relatively small,
1268.0	1277.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: but I think we both love it, in terms of trying to--we identify--my wife Shirley and I,
1277.0	1284.0	you know, we're first-generation, we're born here, so we identify very much with what the immigrant are going through.
1284.0	1292.0	And so our church has a Chinatown Service Center that caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth.
1292.0	1302.0	So we both are very, very involved with that. We have a program that where we tutor immigrants with their English and help them with their citizenship.
1302.0	1477.85	"So for both of us, it's been very, very rewarding. 
<i>Speaker 3</i>: So I mean, so what is the aura about Chinatown that makes Chinatown a Chinatown? You know, as, so, you know, what is it? We're talking a lot of intangibles here, seems, like, you know, a lot of real stuff too, but a lot of intangibles, would you say that, agree with that, Ted? 
<i>Speaker 4</i>: yea, so, so I hope that there is, actually I hope other people can contribute to my experiences as well. The idea of a Chinatown is, is where,  I remember one time somebody asked me, he says, ""why should we..should we or should we not preserve Chinatown?  This is actually a Boston Urban Planner, a Chinatown Urban Planner, he says, ya know that's a philosophical question if you ask me how do we preserve Chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and the constructions and the sights and so forth, well, that's a question I can answer as an engineer or a designer. But if you ask me should we or should we not preserve Chinatown, then that's a philosophical question and I'm not sure all of us have the right answer to that.  Another person said to me, I says, Chinatown is where the Chinese people are. If that's the case, then if you use the D.C. example then there are not that many Chinese residents physically, people living in Chinatown many more are moving toward Rockville, everybody knows that.  If you are talking about where the food is, there are good Chinese restaurants in Chinatown there are others and even more in other places...in Maryland and different places of this sort. In New York you talk about not just one Chinatown on Mott Street, you talk about three or four Chinatowns because the different congregations of people and the restaurants have moved. In Philadelphia, the restaurants have moved and so forth and so on.  So what is it that makes Chinatown, Chinatown and where things are?  Think about it again. Right now, there are more Chinese festivals being done in urban areas where you have these big festivals being done say at Tyson's Corner or Oak or at one of the malls.  They have these great dances all day long for Chinese New Year or Ching Ming and you would go there and everybody would celebrate those things and learn a little bit and eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about Chinese culture. But you would never say that Tyson's Corner or Fair Oaks mall is Chinatown.  You would never say that, right? And you would have a hard time saying just because there's a concentration of people in Rockville, that Rockville is Chinatown. There's something about that term Chinatown in these historical Chinatowns that makes this what it is and I'm not sure what it is."
1493.0	1654.52	"[ The speaker is being asked a question but I cannot understand it] 
<i>Speaker 1</i>: yes, yes, So, but at the same time, he is saying, that how do you keep a Chinatown in the country in a country that is as diverse as the Unites States is. That raises another interesting question.  Everybody else, other ethic groups have their own barrios, their own fisherman's wharf or something of this sort. Should all those places be preserved separately as we grow.  As we grow, we remember  that I was raised in say, a part of New York City, but I don't necessarily want to maintain that area.  If I were raised in the projects in Detroit, that's defined my character and stuff, but I don't necessarily want to preserve that, that building, right.  But why is it then that we want to preserve that Chinatown area? Do we have any answers to that? 
<i>Speaker 2</i>: Yea, who has answers to that?  My own answers somewhat, I agree, it's hard when to answer. But, ya know, I'm saying that what I read earlier, is that Chinatown has its own deeply felt history and stories of national, cultural significance and I think one thing about Chinatown is it was a protective area for us as opposed, this is where we had to be and I think there's lots of stories there that need to be preserved. If not, the structures themselves, then the stories that go behind why were Chinatowns there.  I think that's an important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about.  Why did the Chinese population retreat into these Chinatowns? And they got the reputation..it's not because they wanted to per say, but they were kind of forced into that area and they persevered there and I think that's how they became a stronger community it made for a sense of community and I think that kind of history is there.  I don't know if you disagree or not agree with me Walter... 
<i>Speaker 1</i>: Part of the community part of it is the community, the current community there, the historical community, but part of it is sort of the Hollywood myth of Chinatown. You know, you have Chinatown movies you have, everybody, you talk about the for better or worse, whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this.  Chinatown evokes an image that I think other, other ethic communities necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for Chinese Americans, yeah."
1659.0	1691.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: [[??]] and culture {SPEAKER name=Woman} I grew up in Oklahoma, just like you guys where there is nobody else and just that sense of going back and going to a place where historically Chinese [[??]] and you see where perhaps [[??]] and so I think thats, it's something that you might could find in a history museum [[??]] you don't have that same sense of feeling or real culture.
1691.0	1724.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Speaker 1: Wh-wh-why is that? So, one of the things she's saying is that, growing up in Oklahoma, you come back much like Stan is saying, or Walter is saying, you come in and suddenly you surround it by, uh, things that your parents, or grandparents, all that kinda stuff that kinda happens. And that gives you another sense of uh, a part of your identity and history. But why is it that, you get that from a chinatown, and not from , say, going to the Chinese historical museum in New York, or the Angel Island Museum, in... Why is it that it's a Chinatown, that-that does that? That place..
1724.0	1778.0	"{SPEAKER name=""Speaker 2} Speaker 2: Y=You know, I think it's just an aura there, th-th-that does that, 'cause I-I-I agree that what you're saying there because, y'know, I don't speak Chinese, y'know, so, y'know, so people say they go to China so they can hear people speakin' their same language- I don't understand a word that's being said there- b-by Chinese people there. Since, so, y'know, and I- like I said, I ran away from my Chinese heritage. S-So I really.. Don't identify, but somehow, when I'm there, y-y'know, I feel like, ""Hey, stay in your home"". Uh, and, and, y'know, I use the term, it's a cultural touchstone for me. Uh, in my personal journey and I think that resonates with a lot of people like me who've had who've kind of run away from their identity or are not sure what their identity is because the duality that we, Chinese Americans face in this country you know living especially second generation people like us."
1778.0	1780.0	{SPEAKER name=man in background} third generation, fourth generation.
1780.0	1883.91	<i>Speaker 1</i>: yeah, yeah I think for those who Chinese Americans who are born here you know we may tend to view Chinatown more as in the abstract as something that has enduring meaning, I think it does because it is a part of our history and so forth but I think there is another level that is much more basic and I think that is for the immigrants that come they seek comfort in like kind languages and other people who have had experiences just like them and so it to me it's it's very very basic really. It's security for immigrants who've come and I think when you find someone who is sharing somewhat the same experience that you are about to embark on it provides a tremendous amount of comfort and security so even in D.C. Chinatown when we look at it we may find that it seems to be relatively small but really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants I think it means so much to them and I think we see that in our interaction at the Chinatown service center, the immigrants that come in for help sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation, they get something in the mail and they don't know what this is so you can. I think what we always try to do is put ourselves in an immigrants place, imagine if you were to go to China and know not a word of Chinese and then how would you cope? And so I think that is the attitude that we take when we assist immigrants who come to the Chinatown service center seeking help.
1887.0	1898.0	<i>Kirk</i>: It sounds like what you all are saying is that the physical Chinatown keeps getting smaller in many places, Washington included.
1898.0	1910.0	Do you have any thoughts on how we can preserve Chinatown and maybe not just the physical, but perhaps also the histories that you're talking about, the cultural histories?
1910.0	1921.0	"{Unknown Background Speaker}: Good question. 
<i>Speaker 1</i>: That's a real toughie Kirk uh you know as you ask, how do we ask the question I really want to present here as sort of our assignment, you know, how do we do this?"
1921.0	1929.0	How do we maintain - cause you're not going to--we're not, you know-- DC Chinatown is not going to have a lot of residents again, you know,
1929.0	1941.0	Like San Francisco where you're selling fish on the open market there and things like that and a lot of people living there and speaking the language in Chinese and dialects and so forth,
1941.0	1957.0	So that's a hard one to answer, you know, how do we preserve this feeling here and preserve this- most of all- the history that's been there and of the people who lived there, played there, laughed and cried there - the whole thing?
1957.0	1965.0	{Speaker 2}: So part of it is, you have to maintain the physical appearance of the town, the boundaries that define it,
1965.0	1974.0	whether it's the architecture, the little-- whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another question-- but there's something that allows it to be distinct.
1974.0	1987.0	So in DC Chinatown for example, shops have to have Chinese characters on their windows, right? And so, those kind of things seem superficial, but they are still important enough to help define that space.
1987.0	1996.0	And what you do in that space is important, what are the activities that you do there? Do you allow the family associations to continue to operate there?
1996.0	2005.0	Does the city give it enough--the family associations were talking very much about the [[??]] Association, the [[??]] Association, [[??]], and things of these sorts.
2005.0	2021.0	These things don't have the original purpose that they had in the sense that, everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke Chinese, Chinese did not speak English, and they did a lot of extra, or judiciary, or sort of semi-judiciary types of functions.
2021.0	2038.0	But they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association still represents thirty-some odd associations of Chinese people and organizations - they do annually the Chinese New Year parade.
2038.0	2044.0	Those type of things are important still to do, and we should have the city- and continue to encourage that.
2044.0	2054.0	The buildings space doesn't have places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which [[??]] is talking about.
2054.0	2063.0	So if the people are--have gone there, and live there, and have a story to tell -- we ought to have a way to preserve it.
2063.0	2083.0	And then to--once we preserve it-- to tell it so that the next generation or other people, not just next generation Chinese, but other people that are passing through Chinatown know that there are stories created in Chinatown that represented the Chinese identity, or diaspora that happened to be in DC.
2083.0	2086.8	Um, you had another question? {Unknown Speaker 2}: Yeah--
2098.0	2099.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Yes
2099.0	2135.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: And as gentrification has occurred in Chinatown more and more of the Chinese businesses are getting bought up but it's like, it's like the burger joints and whatnot with Chinese lettering. My question to you is do you, is there a fear that with time and with Realestate properties going up that eventually small Chinese businesses in Chinatown will get bought up? You know it is looking very [[??]] and certainly it is a lot more secure than what you see before but how do we keep Chinatown Chinese?
2135.0	2222.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Correct. And so one of the issues there, that very much is on top of everybody's mind. If you think about Chinatown and what makes it it's the individual entrepreneurs, the mom and pop shops, the little things like that that sell the [[??]] and the all that kind of stuff that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up, there is no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so for like this. And at a certain point those people that operate those businesses like my mom and dad, they are getting old and quit frankly they worked really hard to get you in college so you can get that law degree right? And you are not going to go back there and run the place so those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things that us that are looking at property uh the development of China how do we encourage something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed, it's already gone by right? So, so I'm not sure what the real answer is to that, it could be city, maybe the city has to produce some kind of, of tax incentive that allows these things to stay. But, do you really want to do that, do you really want to encourage a small business that doesn't, that doesn't really make itself productive or do you have an ordinance that say there should be Asian related or Chinese? Those are all questions for us [[??]].
2222.0	2264.0	my feeling just to finish off is that I think, I think  what we many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. I would like to see big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there it allows us to do those things that make our Chinese life significant. The wedding, the, the [[??]], the Ching-Ming festival or something where you bring your family there. You have to create so, it's not so much that small definition of a shop but it is a Chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities.
2264.0	2269.0	<i>Speaker 2</i>: Yeah. So, we'er almost at the end of our time so we got closing comments here.
2269.0	2286.33	{SPEAKER name=woman} uh yeah I um I agree that it is difficult to have small business it's just not profitable um also I think housing is also a problem. Thats why people can't afford to live there. We have all these expensive condominiums
2288.0	2306.0	{SPEAKER=Woman} Unless you have, you know, a high income. It seems impossible. So, but we do have people who do want to live there. They want to raise their families there. And there's no affordable housing. And low-income housing seems to be disappearing too. So, there's all sorts of problems and I really don't know what can be done, really.
2306.0	2376.0	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Yeah, my fear is that what we're going to end up having in DC‚Äîbecause of the gentrification and so forth‚Äîis that what we're going to end up having is a commercial Chinatown. Where we have very few residents living there. And that would be a real shame, really. I think in Las Vegas, they have what they called a Chinatown in a mall. To me, that is not a Chinatown, really. And I think it's incumbent upon the city to provide affordable housing. Right now, there's 3 billion affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping block. Because it's such a hot area, they want to turn that into a condominium. So, I don't really know what the answer is basically. I think at the very least what we need is an infusion of capital with... We have the foot trafficking area. The area is really a hot area now. But we need some entrepreneurs with some Chinese connections who's willing to invest in the area. Right now we have businesses like Panera, Starbucks, they're all coming in. But the Chinese entrepreneurs, I think, are unwilling to make the investment.
2376.0	2497.85	<i>Speaker 2</i>: Okay. Very good. I think I agree with all that. One point that I did want to emphasize on yours that, you know, I certainly don't want it to be a commercial Chinatown. None of us want a Disneyland atmosphere there for tourists to come in and gawk at the Chinese people there. And that's not a Chinatown. We want it to be meaningful. I think what they're saying is right. We're going to have help from the city planners to bring in the right businesses and make the right conditions there to make it work. [Clears throat] Excuse me. So, coming to the end here. So, again, I want to read again from this quote here 'cause I think it's very significant that what Bonnie Tsui says in his book here, says: The myth of America lies in its patchwork heritage. Though the United States hasn't always tolerated difference, it continues‚Äîto this day‚Äîto be built by immigrants. This contradiction in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening: the birth of cultural pride is still evolving. Visitors of Chinatown have a role‚Äîwe all have a role‚Äîjust as residents do in a bartering of culture currency. If there's authenticity to be experienced, it's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. This is a reminder of what makes America special. After a century and a half of Chinese immigration, Chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into America and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese heritage. And so, thank you all for your attention today. And I thank Ted, Walter, and Shirley for their participation here. And really, I said you guys got your assignments today. You helped us out. Helped us with Chinatowns. You know, make it work for us. Make it work for you too. Thank you.
2507.0	2539.92	<i>Speaker 1</i>: Yeah uh, don't go too far away because starting in just a few more minutes we'll have another panel discussion, this one entitled Young Historians Living Histories. So starting in a just a few minutes as we get set up, Young Historians Living Histories. Yeah no, we're moving onto the next one. So I'd like to welcome you to day Number Five of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Today is diaspora day and that's diaspora day both for
