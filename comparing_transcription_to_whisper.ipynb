      "REF: Speaker 1: Hello, hello  everyone we're getting set up for our next session in Teahouse Commons.   Speaker 1: You are in the China Program of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Speaker 1: This program is presented through a collaboration by the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian with the China International Cultural Association, working with the China Arts and Entertainment Group in Beijing. Speaker 1: Thanks a lot for being here. Today I don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different today. Speaker 1: The China Festival program actually brought over 120 artists and presenters from China to participate in this program. Speaker 1: But today    we are doing something a little bit different, we're calling it \"Diaspora Day\". Speaker 1: There are about    4 million people of Chinese ancestry in the United States, and today we're celebrating the way in which when people move, how they transform and adapt culture, community, and traditions to the new ****** places where they end up. Speaker 1: So today this **** session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is * apart of the Diaspora Day programming, which is also co-produced with the Smithsonian ***** Asian-Pacific American Center. Speaker 1: So we have um today's session right now that   that we're getting ready to start is the 1882 Foundation Talk Story on the Mall, and we are going to be talking about ***** **** Chinatown today, Chinatown Today is the subject of this session. Speaker 1: And I'm going to go ahead and introduce to you Stan Liu, who is going to do the presenting and *** moderating of this session **** *** with our experts here today, our local experts. Speaker 1: I want to first introduce you to Stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 Foundation. [SILENCE] Speaker 1: So Stan Liu, sitting right here to my left, is a retired civil engineer. He used to work for the Federal Aviation Administration, and he went to China for the first time in 2003. Speaker 1: 2003, he spent two years *** *****   there teaching Chinese at a university, and when he came back to the US he became very interested and committed with working with Chinese American organizations. Speaker 1: Stan is himself a native of Greenville, Mississippi, which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic, um, but Stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of Chinese Americans, as well as the 1882 foundation. Speaker 1: and for those of you who don't know, the 1882 Foundation is a non-partisan, non-profit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of Chinese exclusion laws, Speaker 1: and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep Chinese immigrants out of the United States and ** prevent those who were here already from ever attaining citizenship. Speaker 1: So    they have been doing really wonderful work around the country  um and I'm now going to turn it over to Stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel. Speaker    2: ok, thank you Sojin, Speaker   2: hey! Speaker 2: it's a pleasure for us to be here on the Mall doing our Talk Story on the Mall and uh we're-and this is Diaspora Day, like ** Sojin was saying here, and we're gonna, I'm gonna introduce everybody here Speaker 2:    and we're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are  'cause I don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over credentials that ** really don't matter. Speaker 2: You know, what we say is what's gonna be important. Speaker 2: So [SILENCE] Speaker 2: So this is Diaspora Day and you know, and you know, the epitome of diasporas in the United States of course are Chinatowns, Speaker 2: and that's ****** what we think about when when *******    we talk   about displaced Chinese *** *** away from China in the United States, Speaker    2: Chinatowns are the first things that come to my mind, and *** ***   so when we put out our flyer, you know we said **** *** that-that, uhh, we're gonna talk about Chinatown today,   and uh, but this is not gonna to be a ****** travelogue, by any ****** means. Speaker 2: we're gonna talk about what ***** Chinatown means to us, and     uh, because like we said in the ***** flyer, Chinatown has different meanings to different people, Speaker 2: and one of the references I have is this book called ******** ùòàùòÆùò¶ùò≥ùò™ùò§ùò¢ùòØ ùòäùò©ùò™ùòØùò¢ùòµùò∞ùò∏ùòØùò¥ written by Bonnie Tsui; and so I'll just read briefly what she says about, you know, Chinatown USA. Speaker 2: \"a state of mind, a world within a world, a neighbourhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine, every day   Speaker 2: [SILENCE] Speaker 2: \"Americans find something different in Chinatown.\" Speaker   2: \"Its a place as foreign, yet familiar, by now quite well known on the Western-cultural   radar, Speaker  2: but splitting the difference still gives many visitors to ***** Chinatown the sense above all, that things are not Speaker 2: [SILENCE] Speaker 2: \"what they seem, and   [uhh] popular cultural's been telling us this for decades, and it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm.\" Speaker 2: \"A place with its own deeply felt history and stories of national-cultural significance.\"       Speaker 2: So, you know, our panel today is going to talk about, you know, what this means to ** the APA community,    uhh, Chinese-American community from our viewpoint, Speaker        2: and then we don't, we won't agree on ********** ******* everything, 'cause, as you, as those of you who are, uhh, Chinese Americans or Chinese, know **** that, y'know, there's very, Speaker 2: we argue a lot. Speaker 2: So we have differences of opinion about what ***** Chinatown means to us and we have, and certainly the three panellists here all,  we all, have our own opinions about it, and uh, Speaker 2: But one thing that, you know, and I also want you and the audience to be thinking about it ** too, \"what does ***** Chinatown mean to you?\" Speaker 2: and you know, that's ***** gonna be your     take away for today Is come out of this **** session here, real uh, thinking about what ***** Chinatown means Speaker 2: when you ** go, about, if you're here in the DC area, go to DC ***** Chinatown, and say you know, what does it mean, to you, and you know, what-and-and,   cause it's changing every day. Speaker    2: Chinatowns, and so are  those of you from out of town, go back to your hometowns and *** look at *** these Chinatowns there, and what   do they mean to you? Speaker     2: That's-that's your assignment **** from-coming from the day, but, so our, our group here, one thing we have in  common I ***** think, is-is that we, we all are all, ABCs. Speaker 2: That's American Born Chinese. Speaker 2: So you know, we, uh, have that perspective **** that-that, we aren't, we-we're born in this  country so we are Americans, but we're   also, but we're really, definitely Chinese Americans. Speaker 2: We're all active in ** the DC ***** Chinatown, and we do participate in our talk story events that we have, in Chinatown, every month. Speaker    2: Where we gather the community together to-to share stories of our experiences as growing up as Chinese Americans, Asian Americans, Speaker 2: you know and what that means, in and you know, we have this monthly in ** ***** Chinatown and so if you want, if you're ********** interested, if you're in the area, you know, talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are going to be. Speaker 2: But for today, it's ***** Chinatown, I-I, it's-it's, Talk Story on the Mall, and so I'm gonna, the way we're gonna introduce ****     each, ourselves, is-I'm gonna go down here and *** ask the question, you know, Speaker   2: \"what does Chinatown mean to you\", Speaker 2: [SILENCE] Speaker 2: and \"how is it important to you?\" Speaker 2: and then, you know, tell us who you are, you know,  and what's your relationship is, and then, and then uh, tell us Speaker 2: [SILENCE] Speaker 2: you want to start, Shirly Wu, uh, is-is involved, so tell us about who you are, and **** what, and answer the questions. Speaker     2: [SILENCE] Shirley  Wu:    Ah yeah. My name is Shirley  Wu,  actually I was born in Washington, D.C., and my involvement in ***** Chinatown is because I'm the director of the ***** Chinatown Service Center, which is part of the Chinese Community Church  -- the only Chinese Community Church in Washington D.C., we like to say! And actually the reason I'm here is because, another lady, wasn't   able to make it, and she really was born and worked in ***** Chinatown for many years, and she had one of the first stores in ***** Chinatown that's still in existence today. Anyway, I'm here to, to be part of this panel, and   to tell you that ***** Chinatown is very meaningful to me, even though I was born in D.C., and then my parents used to come to ***** Chinatown when we were quite young, and at that time it was a lot different, it was a lot ******* smaller, lot quieter, and it was a way for people to meet people like themselves that speak their languages, to have a cup of tea, to go over all news about what was happening in China, what was going on in America. And I think it's important to me because it is a community, even though we think of it as maybe just a place people come to eat or   as a touristy place, but there are real residents that live there, and it's important, I think, to maintain that. Walter Wu: Thank you Shirley. My name is Walter Wu, I'm Shirley's husband,[[laughs]] and I also help at the Chinatown Service Center, which is a part of the Chinese Community Church, which is located in the heart of ********** Chinatown, it's, that's where we worship. I am an A.B.C,  an American Born Chinese. I was born in Texas, a transplant here in 1972, and in San Antonio, we didn't have a Chinatown. And I think for that reason I have a special appreciation, if not a greater appreciation of Chinatown. Even though the one in D.C., it's quite small, as compared, let's say, to the ones in New York or San Francisco or Los Angeles. We tutor immigrants with their, help them improve their English; on Saturday mornings, we have a program, and we also help them with their citizenship, and we know how valuable that the ********* residents find living in Chinatown is. You know, we, you may go to Chinatown, it, it may have shrunk in terms of the commercial Chinatown, in terms of the number of restaurants, but I think you will see, you'll find a significant number of Chinese that live there. They **** live in, mainly in three public housing projects located not that far from the heart of Chinatown. So I think the, when we help not just ourselves, but we have others too, we have one of our tutors, actually, who's here, who's been a long-time tutor at our Saturday program, and I think the reward that we get is that when we help immigrants improve their English or help them in some way, we can see the smile on their face, we can see the appreciation, and we can see the gratitude that they have. And Chinatown, what it is, it's, it provides an instant * community for the Chinese to         do fellowship with other Chinese and with similar language, so it's really, a, a very key part in helping assimilate into this country. Speaker 1: Um So my **** name's Ted Gong. I'm *** from California and, everybody's using these terms 'A.B.C' Speaker 1: and I'm 'A.B.C.' and American-Born Chinese, but as you guys all know probably, there's always, like, 'H.I.P.' - Hong Kong Instant Product, M.I.T   -- Made in Taiwan, all that kind of stuff like ***** this! But, A.B.C.-- when I s--I was--I'm about a fourth or ***** fifth-generation Chinese from California, from Fresno. Anybody from Fresno? Anybody know Fresno? [[laughs]] Anyway, Rural Fresno. And we of course didn't have a Chinatown there, and the Chinatown that we always go to is either San Francisco, primarily, or to Los Angeles. Speaker  1: And, you know? The thing about growing up in *** rural California is, I think there's probably like one or two other Chinese families in my town; mostly we pick-- I was just talking with  someone about picking   gr-- --cotton, you know, and the long cotton bags and you dragged the cotton bags and doing things like this. But you would always -- my Mom and Dad ran a grocery ***** ** ** store--a little tiny grocery store in Orosi, California, near   Dinuba California, which is  near Fresno. But we would always have these things where Mom and Dad would always ***  say, 'We've gotta go to Taifu, Taifu, San Francisco Chinatown. You have to go back to buy the groceries, to get to talk to the ** *** family folk, to have the banquets, to have the weddings, and so forth. So Chinatown has that meaning as well. It is a place in which you rejuvenate in many levels. One, to get the groceries that you can't get in  rural California. To get the **** food, the banquet, that familiar taste. To talk with those relatives, to have those banquets and those meals, and so forth. Chinatown, historically, and this D.C. China[[town]] has had that same purpose, has ******* changed over--originally a place for immigrants to **** come--still is a place for immigrants to come; to get the skills, the language, get used to the America, America, so that they can go off and do better ****** things. Before, Chinatown has other purposes. During the Exclusion  Act -- we talk about the 1882 Exclusion Act          -- Chinatowns were actually a protective place. You know, in 1882, 1800s and so forth if you were Chinese in     a rural part of California during the time when the Chinese Exclusion Acts was going on, the expulsion period, you could be killed, you know? And Chinatown was a protective enclave. That is the place where  Chinatowns gather together and protect themselves. In California, just to let you know, after the Exclusion Acts, and the period which they call the expulsion period, there were officially 200 round-ups of Chinese, rural Chinese, kicked out of the areas, or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge Chinese from the districts.  So China[[towns]] functioned as a place, a protective place. Later on, it becomes a place where immigrants get skills. Later on, it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the community, like in D.C. here. The original D.C. Chinatown here, does anybody know where the original D.C. Chinatown was? It's at Federal Triangle! The original Chinatown was the Federal Triangle, and it's ****** expand--it was then pushed off to where it is now and it's now constricted to where it is. So it continues to evolve. But ***** there's something about Chinatown that is different. There is a sense that Chinatown is a place where you can get identity. It's linked with ******* Chinese-American identity, it's linked with our culture, it's linked with a desire to go back, like myself, to find those things which make up our culture and our identity. Chinatown can be a concept as well as a place. Speaker   2: Very good. Very good. So yeah, I think that all three of you, what you said is is, you know, right on,  you know, it's different, there's different views of what Chinatown is, Speaker 2: and again I'm going to quote from this book here, because I think it has some great quotes in it, here. 'The truth is that Chinatown is a space of self-invention. Speaker 2: The oldest Chinese immigrants, including, but not limited to, those who landed in the port cities of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Speaker 2: had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large. Speaker 2: These days, new immigrants continue to come for a new life, and a search for --and a search for a cultural ******** identity,  brings Chinese-Americans of many generations back to walk alongside them.' Speaker 2: And I guess, you know, I **** kinda follow in that latter category about looking for     my self-identity, Speaker 2: because, you know, what Chinatown means to me is, you know, I feel good there, for some reason. Speaker   2: You know, I can't explain it because, you know, my upbringing was *** such that I grew up in Mississippi, like ** Sojin said, during the '40s and '50s, during extremely a bad time there, Speaker 2: where I --it it was just not fun being Chinese! You know, we were picked on, we were abused, and we couldn't go to schools with anybody else, where they had to build a one-room schoolhouse Speaker 2: for us where we had all of *** our--all the families in the city of Greenville in one ****** schoolhouse that housed all 12 grades with one teacher. Speaker 2: So, you **** know, for--that was kind of   the life I was brought up with, and so I said,  hey it's no fun being Chinese, Speaker 2: I'm not going to be Chinese. So I,  I,   you know I literally rejected my heritage, ran away from it, you know, tried to forget who I was, Speaker  2: and--and so my long journey **** back--so I'm on this journey of self-discovery now, Speaker 2: 'cause I--I think I've come back, you know, I'm proud to be ******* Chinese-American now, and it's part ** *** of--Chinatown's a part of my-- Speaker 2: helped me in finding ****** ******** ***   my self-identity.    And that's--I think that's a very key part of **** why we're espousing **** what--the importance of Chinatowns, here. For me, Speaker      2: it's a personal journey, I think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community *** *** *** ***** and--so--I would like to ask, you know, Walter and Shirley, Speaker   2: you know, as you grew up, you know, maybe   your growing up wasn't as drastic as mine, [[laughs]] Speaker 2: I don't know--you know, I didn't handle it well,  I mean you probably handled it *** better than I did, but, you know, so how did that influence *** **** how you you review  Chinatowns now *** and, you know,  why  is it ***** mean--your growing *** up--even though you didn't grow up in a Chinatown? Speaker 1: Ah-- Speaker 1: [[Shirley Woo]] It's not as drastic as that! Ah, yeah I grew up in D.C. um Actually, ah, we had a laundry in ********* South East, near--just over the bridge, Pennsylvania Avenue. And at that time, in the schools I went to, elementary and even middle school, there weren't that many Asians, so of course I always stood out [[laughs]]. There would be, like, maybe one other girl who might be Chinese, and then she moved away and I'd be only Asian person there. And my friends were always ** be amazed at the beginning of school year how teachers would always remember my name! But of course, you know, I was the only person who was Asian, who  you know, had black hair, black eyes, or whatever. So I was always, am aware that I'm Chinese, I'm different from my Caucasian friends, even though, they probably didn't look at me that way, which was good! But I always knew that I was different, you know. My food was different at home. I didn't eat sandwiches like they  did and, you know, we always had rice at lunchtime, you know. It was just different, you know. I had to stay in, and, you know, we had a laundry, and you know, and their parents   live in a house! And so my dream was,    some day that I was gonna have a house too, and **** *** be like that Dick and Jane book, and have a dog and a cat, and Daddy would go to work and Mommy would stay home! [[laughs]] But anyway, we do have a house, so I did live-- be able to live this American dream. But yeah, I'm always aware that I'm Chinese. And Chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to ** meet their friends, again, you know, to talk, to meet people of their same ********* *** languages. That's always important for everybody. Speaker 2: [[Walter Woo]] Well, my background was entirely different. Speaker 2: I grew up in Texas, actually I was born in San Antonio, where the major population       is Hispanic, Speaker 2: so there really weren't that many Chinese ***** *** there. Speaker  2:  And, so it--we did--what Chinese food we ate was *** from my mother's cooking at home,  basically [[laughs]]. You know, so we didn't have a Chinatown, Speaker 2: or anything like that. We'd visit relatives who    were Chinese, and so forth, and that was about the extent of the Chinese population. Speaker 2: So when I came to  Washington D.C. to work in 1972, ended up staying because I met my wife here, Speaker 2: but I remember when I visited New York City for the first time during Chinese New Year, Speaker 2: I was just so mesmerized by the number of Chinese in New York Chinatown. Speaker 2: I mean, to me, it was so impressive to see so many Chinese there. I--I--I was thrilled to death, really. Speaker 2: I never experienced something like that. So **** ***** it--it--it's great, really. It's, it's a great thrill, you know, to be among other Chinese and to *** see--going   to a Chinatown Speaker 2: where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth, and    they all were so thriving, really. So it really was an eye-opening experience for me, and it's something that I always will appreciate and even though the D.C. Chinatown is relatively small, Speaker 2: but I think we both love it, in terms of trying ** ** ******** to--we identify--my wife Shirley and I, you know, we're ***** first-generation, we're born here, so we identify very much with what the  immigrant are going through. And so our church has a Chinatown Service Center that caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth. So we both are very, very involved with that. We have a program that where we tutor immigrants with their English and help them with their citizenship. So for both of us, it's been very, very rewarding. Speaker 3: So I mean, so what **** is the aura about Chinatown that makes Chinatown a ********** Chinatown?  You know, as, so, you know, what is it? We're talking a lot of intangibles here, seems, like,  you know, a lot of real stuff *** too, but *****   a  lot of intangibles, would you say that, agree with that, Ted? Speaker 4: yea, so, so I hope that there is, actually I hope **** other people can contribute   to    my experiences as well. The idea of a Chinatown **   is,  is where, I remember one ****** *** time somebody asked me, he **** **** ** says, \"why should ** we..should we or should we not preserve Chinatown? This is actually a Boston Urban Planner,         a Chinatown   Urban Planner, he says,  ya  know that's a *** ****** * philosophical question if you ask me how do  we preserve Chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and the constructions and the sights and so forth, well, that's a question I can answer as an engineer or a designer. But if you ask me should we or should we not preserve Chinatown, then that's a ******** ** * *** philosophical question and I'm not sure all of us have the right answer to that. Another person said to me,    I says, Chinatown is where the Chinese people are. If that's the case, then if you use the D.C.  example then there are not that many Chinese residents physically, people living in Chinatown ******* many more are moving toward Rockville, everybody knows that. If    you are talking about where the food is, there are good Chinese restaurants in Chinatown there are others and even more   in other ****** places...in Maryland and different places of this **** sort. In New York you talk about not just one Chinatown on Mott Street, you talk about three or four Chinatowns because the different congregations of people and   the restaurants have moved. In Philadelphia, the restaurants have moved and so forth and *** so on. So what is it that makes Chinatown, Chinatown and where things are? Think about it again. Right now, there are more Chinese festivals being done in *** urban areas where you have these big festivals being done say at Tyson's Corner or Oak or at one of the ***** malls. They have these great dances all day long for Chinese New Year or Ching     Ming and you would go there and everybody would celebrate those things and learn a little bit and eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about Chinese culture. But you would never say that Tyson's Corner or Fair Oaks mall is ********* Chinatown. You would never say **** that, right? And you would have a hard time saying just because there's a concentration of people in Rockville, that Rockville is Chinatown. There's something about that term Chinatown in these historical Chinatowns that **** makes this what it is and I'm not sure what it is.    [ The speaker is being asked a question but   I cannot understand it] Speaker 1: yes, yes, So, but at the same **** time, he is saying, that how do you *** *** ** *** keep a Chinatown in the country in a country that is as diverse as the Unites States is. That raises another interesting question. Everybody else, other  ethic groups have their own barrios, their own fisherman's wharf  or something of this sort. Should all those places be preserved separately as we grow. As we grow, we remember that I was raised  in say, a part of New York City, but I don't necessarily want to maintain that area. If I were raised in the projects in Detroit, that's defined my character and stuff, but I don't necessarily want to preserve that, that **** **** building, right. But why is it then that ** we want to preserve that Chinatown area? Do we have any answers to that? Speaker 2: Yea, who has answers to that? *** **** My own ** *** ******  answers somewhat, I ****** * **** ** agree, it's hard when to answer. But,  ya know, I'm saying that *** **** what I **** * read **** * **** earlier, is that **** Chinatown *** **** has its own deeply   felt history and stories of national, cultural significance and I think one ** ***  thing about Chinatown is it was a protective area for us as ******* ** *** opposed, this is where we had to be and I think *** **** there's lots of stories there that need to be ********* *** preserved. If not, the structures ** themselves, then the stories that go behind **** why ***** ***** *** were Chinatowns there. I think that's an important history lesson for all of us in this country to know ***** *** **** *** **** about. Why did **** the *** Chinese  population retreat into these ********** *** Chinatowns? And they got the ********** reputation..it's not because **** *** **** they wanted to per ** say, but **** they were **** **** kind of forced into that area and they persevered there and I think that's how they became a stronger community it made for a sense of community and I think that **** kind of history is there. I don't ***** * ***** know if you disagree or not agree with me ****** ** Walter... Speaker 1: Part of the community ** part of it is the community, the current community there, the historical community, but part of it is sort of the Hollywood myth of ********* Chinatown. You know, you have Chinatown movies you have, everybody, you talk about the for better or worse, whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this. Chinatown evokes an image that I think other, other * ethic communities ***** necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for *** Chinese Americans, yeah.   Speaker 1: [[??]] and culture {SPEAKER name=Woman} I  grew     up   in Oklahoma, just like you guys where there is nobody else and just that sense of going back and going to a place where historically Chinese [[??]] and you see where perhaps [[??]] and so I think thats, it's something that you might could find in a history museum [[??]] you don't have that same sense of feeling or real culture. Speaker 1: Speaker 1: Wh-wh-why is that? So, one of the things she's saying is that, growing up       in Oklahoma, you come back much like Stan is saying, or Walter is saying, you come in and suddenly you surround it by,    uh, things that your parents, or grandparents, all that **** kinda stuff that   kinda happens. And that gives you another sense of  uh, a part of your identity and history. But why is   it that, you get that from a chinatown, and not from   , say, going to the Chinese historical museum in New York, or the Angel Island Museum, in... Why is it that it's a Chinatown, that-that does that? That place.. {SPEAKER name=\"Speaker 2} Speaker 2: Y=You know, I think it's just an aura there, th-th-that does that,  'cause I-I-I agree that what you're saying there ******* because, y'know, I don't speak ******* Chinese, y'know, so, y'know,   so people say they go to   China      so they can hear people speakin'   their   same language- I don't understand a word that's being said there- b-by Chinese people ***** there. Since, so, y'know, and I- like   I said, I ran away from my Chinese heritage. S-So I really.. Don't identify, but somehow, when I'm there, *** y-y'know, I feel **** like,   \"Hey, stay   in your    home\". Uh, and, and, y'know, I use the term, it's a cultural touchstone for me. Uh, in my personal journey and I think ** * ***** that resonates with    a lot of people like me *** who've had ** who've kind of run away from their identity or are not sure what their identity is because the duality that we, Chinese Americans face in this  country you ***** *** know living especially second generation people like us. {SPEAKER name=man         in background} third generation, fourth generation. Speaker    1: yeah, yeah I think for those who Chinese Americans who are born here you  know we may tend to view Chinatown more as in the abstract as something that has enduring ******* meaning, I think it does because   it   is a part of our history and so forth *** * but I think   there is another level  that is much more basic and I think that is for the immigrants that come *** ***** they seek comfort in like kind languages and other people    who have had experiences just like them and so it to  me it's it's **** very very basic really. It's security for immigrants who've come and I think when you find someone who is sharing somewhat the same experience that    you are about to embark on it provides a tremendous amount of comfort and security ** so even in D.C. Chinatown when we look at  it we may find that it  seems to be relatively small but really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants I think it means so much to them and I think we see that in our interaction at the Chinatown service center, the immigrants that come in for help sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation, they get something in the mail  and they don't know what this is so you can. I think what we always try to do is put *** ourselves in an immigrants place, imagine if you were to go to China and know not a word of Chinese and then how would you cope? And  so I think that is the attitude that we take when we assist immigrants who come to the Chinatown service center seeking help.  Kirk: It sounds like   what    you all  are saying   is that  the physical Chinatown keeps getting smaller in many places, Washington included. Do you have any thoughts  on how we can preserve Chinatown and maybe not just the physical, but perhaps also the histories that you're talking about, the cultural histories? {Unknown Background Speaker}: Good question. Speaker 1: That's a real toughie Kirk uh you know as       you ask, how do we ask the  question I really want to present here as sort of our assignment, you know, how *** do we do this? How *** do we maintain       - cause you're not going to--we're not, you know-- DC  Chinatown   is not going to have a lot of residents ***** *** again, you know, Like San Francisco where you're selling fish *** **** on the open market there and things like that and *** a lot of people living there and speaking the language in Chinese and ** dialects and so forth, So that's a hard one to answer, you know, how do we preserve this **** feeling here and preserve this- most of all- the history that's been there and  of the *** *** people who lived there, played there, laughed and cried there - the whole thing? {Speaker 2}: So part **** of it is, you ** have to maintain the physical appearance of the town,  the boundaries that define it, whether it's the architecture, the little-- whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another question-- but there's something that allows it to be distinct. So in DC Chinatown for example, shops have to have Chinese characters on their windows, right? And so, those kind of things seem superficial, but they are still important enough to help define that space.  And what you do in that space is important, what are the activities that you do there? Do you allow the  family associations to continue to operate there? Does the city  give     it enough--the family associations    were talking very much about the [[??]] Association, the **** ******     [[??]] Association, [[??]], and things of these sorts. These things don't have the original purpose that they  had in the sense that, everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke Chinese, Chinese    did not   speak English, and they did a lot of extra, or judiciary, or sort of **** semi-judiciary types of functions. But they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association still represents ** thirty-some odd associations of Chinese people and organizations - they do annually the Chinese New Year parade. Those type of things are important still to do, and we should have the city- and continue to encourage that. The buildings space **** doesn't have places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which [[??]] is talking about. So if the people **** ** are--have gone there, and  live there, and have a story to tell  -- we ought to have a way to *** preserve it. And then ** to--once we preserve it-- to tell it so that the next generation or other people, not just *** next generation Chinese, but other people that are passing through * ***** Chinatown know that there are stories created in ***** Chinatown that represented the Chinese identity, or diaspora that happened to be in DC. Um, you had another question? {Unknown Speaker 2}: Yeah-- Speaker 1: Yes Speaker 2:     And as gentrification has occurred in Chinatown more and more of the Chinese businesses are getting bought up but it's like, it's like the burger joints and whatnot with Chinese lettering. My question to you is do you, is there a fear that with time and with Realestate properties going up that eventually small Chinese businesses in Chinatown will get bought up? You know it is looking very [[??]] and certainly it is a lot more secure than what you see before but how do we keep Chinatown Chinese? Speaker 1: Correct. And so one of the issues there, that very much is on top of everybody's mind. If you think about ***** Chinatown and what makes it it's the individual entrepreneurs, the mom and pop shops, the little things like that that sell the ****** [[??]] and the all that kind of stuff *** *** that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up,   there is no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so   for like this. And at a certain point those people that operate those businesses like my mom and *** dad,     they     are getting old and  quit frankly they worked really hard to get you in college so you can get that law degree right? And    you are not going to go back there and run  the place so those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things that us that  are looking at property uh the development     of China how do we  encourage something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed, it's already gone by right? So, so I'm not sure what the real answer is to that, it could be city, maybe the city has to produce some kind of, of tax incentive that allows these things to stay. But, do you really want to do that, do you really want to encourage a small business that doesn't, that doesn't really make itself  productive or do you have an ordinance that say there should be ** Asian related or Chinese? Those are all questions for us *********** [[??]]. my ** feeling just to finish off is that I think, I think  what we many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. I would like to see big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there it allows us to do those things that make our Chinese life significant. The wedding, the, the **** *** [[??]], the Ching-Ming festival or something where you bring your family there. You have to create so, it's not so much that small definition of a shop but it is a Chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities. Speaker 2: Yeah.   So, we'er almost at the end of our  time so we got closing comments here. {SPEAKER name=woman} uh yeah I um I agree that it is difficult to have small    business it's just not profitable um also I think housing is also a problem.  Thats why people ****** can't afford to live there. We have all these expensive condominiums {SPEAKER=Woman} Unless you have, you  know, a high income. It seems impossible. So, but we do have people who do want to live there. They want to raise their families there. And there's no affordable housing. And low-income housing seems to be disappearing too. So, there's all sorts of problems and I really don't know ****** what can be done, really. Speaker 1: Yeah, my fear is that what we're going to end up having in ** DC‚Äîbecause of the gentrification and so ***** forth‚Äîis that what we're going to end up having is **** a commercial Chinatown. Where we have very few residents living there. And that would be a real ***** ******* *** shame, really. I think in Las Vegas, they have what they called a Chinatown in a mall. To me, that is not a Chinatown, really. And I think it's incumbent upon the city to provide affordable ******* ***** housing.   Right  now,   there's    3 billion affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping block. Because ******* it's such a hot area, they want to turn that into a condominium. So, I don't really know what the answer is ********* basically. I think at the very least what we **** ** need is an infusion of capital **** ******* *** with... We have ** ***     the foot trafficking area. The area is ** really a hot area now. But we need some entrepreneurs with some Chinese connections who's willing to invest in the area. Right now ** **** we have **** businesses like Panera, Starbucks, they're all coming in. But the Chinese entrepreneurs, I think, are unwilling to make the investment. Speaker   2: Okay.  Very good. I think I agree with all **** *** *** **** **** that. One point that I did want to emphasize on yours that, you know, ** I certainly don't want it to be a commercial ********* ***** * ***** **** ** ** ***** Chinatown. None of us want a Disneyland atmosphere there ***** **** for tourists to come in ***** and gawk at the Chinese people there. And that's not ****** *** a ********* *** Chinatown. We want it to be meaningful. I think what they're saying is right. We're ***** going to have help from the city planners to bring in the right businesses and *** ** make the right conditions there to make it ****  work. [Clears throat] Excuse me.   So, coming to the end here. So, again, I want * **** to read again from **** this quote here  'cause I think it's very significant that what **** ***** Bonnie Tsui says in  his book **** ***** here, says: The myth of America lies in its patchwork heritage. Though the United States hasn't always tolerated difference, it ********* continues‚Äîto this *** day‚Äîto be built by ********** *** immigrants. This contradiction ** in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening: the birth of cultural pride **** is still evolving. Visitors of Chinatown have a ***** role‚Äîwe all have a **** role‚Äîjust as residents do in   a bartering of  culture currency. If there's authenticity to be experienced, it's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. This is a reminder of what makes America ******* *** *** special. After a century and a half of Chinese immigration, Chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into America and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese heritage. And ** so, thank you all for your attention today. And I thank Ted, Walter, and *** Shirley for their participation here. And really, I said you guys got * **** your assignments today. You helped us out. Helped us with Chinatowns. You know, make it **** ** work for ** *****   us. Make it work for  you too. Thank you. Speaker 1: Yeah uh, don't go too far away because starting in just a few more minutes we'll have another panel discussion, this one entitled Young Historians Living Histories. So starting in a just a few minutes as we get set up, Young Historians Living Histories. Yeah   no, we're moving onto the next one. So I'd like to welcome you to day Number Five of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Today is diaspora day and that's diaspora day both for ***\n",
      "HYP: ******* ** Hello, hello everyone. We're getting set up for our next session in      tea    house comments. ** You are in the China program of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife  Festival ******* ** This program is presented through a collaboration by the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian with the China International  Culture  Association Working with the China Arts and Entertainment Group in Beijing. ******* ** Thanks a lot for being  here today I don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different  today     the ** *** China Festival program actually brought over 120 artists and presenters from China to participate in this program,     but ** *** today we're *** doing something a little bit  different We're calling it  diaspora   day ******* ** There are about four million people of Chinese ancestry in the United  States and today We're celebrating the way in which when people  move how they transform and adapt  culture  community and traditions to the new Police places where they end  up      so ** ** today this this session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is a  part of the diaspora day  programming which is also co-produced with the Smithsonian Asian       Pacific American  Center ******* ** So we have ** today's session right now that you're we're getting ready to start is the 1882 foundation talk story on the  mall And we are going to be talking about China town     today  China      town today is the subject of this  session ******* ** And I'm going to go ahead and introduce to *** Stan   Lu who is going to do the presenting and the moderating of this session With our with our experts here  today our local  experts     And ** I want to first introduce you to Stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882  foundation ********* ******* ** So Stan   Lu sitting right here to my  left is a retired civil  engineer He used to work for the Federal Aviation  Administration and he went to China for the first time in  2003    2003 ** ***** he spent two years two years there's Teaching Chinese at a  university and when he came back to the US he became very interested and committed   to working with Chinese American  Organizations ******* ** Stan is himself a native of Greenville,  Mississippi Which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the  mic But *** Stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of Chinese   American as well as the 1882  foundation ******* ** and for those of you who don't  know the 1882 foundation is a   nonpartisan non-profit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of Chinese exclusion  laws ******* ** and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep Chinese immigrants out of the United States and to prevent Those who were here already from ever obtaining  citizenship ******* ** So they've **** been doing really wonderful work around the country And *** I'm now going to turn it over to Stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel.   Okay. Thank *** ***** you     So     Jin hey, **** ******* ** it's * pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and We       and this is diaspora  day like so   Jin was saying  here and ***** ****** I'm gonna introduce everybody here     Are we gonna? We're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are because I don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over Credentials that it really don't matter,     you ** *** know, what we say is what's gonna be  important ******* ** So        so ******* ** ** this is diaspora day and you  know and you  know the epitome of Diasporos in the United States of course are       China   towns ** and that's that's what we think about when when talking about  the display       The Chinese who are away from China in the United  States They're China      towns  is the first  thing   to come to my  mind and so, you know when we put out our  flyer You know we said that you       know that we're gonna talk about     China   town today And but this is not gonna ** be a travel         log by any means,    you    know we  want    to talk about what China      town means to  us and Because ******* like we said in the flyer  China      town has different meanings to different  people ******* ** and one of the references I have ** this book called American    China      towns written by Bonnie  Suey and so I'll just Read briefly what she says  about you  know     China town     USA  a ** state of  mind a world within a  world a  Neighborhood that exists in more cities than you might  imagine every day Americans ** ********* ******* ** ********** find something different in       China    town It's **** a place is  foreign yet  familiar by now quite well known on the          Western cultural   radar But *** splitting the difference still gives many visitors to China      town the sense above  all that things are not    what ** ********* ******* ** ***** they  seem and Popular culture        has been telling us this for  decades And it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on Beneath the surface of the vibrant   microcosm       a ** ** place with its own deeply felt history and Stories of          national       cultural significance, so *** you  know our panel today is going to talk  about you  know what this means to To the APA  community Chinese         American community from our       from     our viewpoint and then we  don't we won't agree on everything because         you    know as  you as those of you who  are **** Chinese Americans or  Chinese know that   you    know there's  very      We ** ** argue a lot,      so ** ** we have differences of opinion about what China      town means to us And we  have and certainly the three  panelists here   We all **** have our own opinions about  it and but ******* ** *** one thing  that you  know And * also what you  in the audience to be thinking about it to  you  What does China      town mean to   you ******* ** and you  know that's going    to be your takeaway **** for today Is come out of this this session  here real *** thinking about what China      town means ******* ** when you go But   when if you're here in the DC  area go to DC China       town and see you  know What does it  mean to  you and you  know           and because it's changing every  day   China towns *********** and so our lowest ** you from out of  town go back to your hometowns and and look at the China      towns  there And what does   it mean to you?      So that's        that's your assignment from      coming from the  day  But so  our our group  here one thing we have in common. I think     is    is that  we we all are  all  ABCs ******* ** That's American born Chinese.     So, ** ** you know,  we *** have that perspective that       that we  aren't    We're born in this country. So we are Americans, but we're awesome But we're  really definitely Chinese  Americans ******* ** We're all active in in the DC China       town and we do participate in our talk story events that we  have in      China  town  Every   month where ***** we gather the community together    to share stories of our experiences as Growing up as Chinese  Americans Asian Americans, ******* ** you know and what that  means ** and you  know We have this monthly in in China      town and so if you  want if you're interested          in if you're in the area, you  know Talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are gonna be *** ******* ** But for today, it's China       town It's       it's talk story on the  mall and so I'm  gonna The way we're gonna introduce each ourselves         is    I'm gonna go down here and and ask the  question you  know    What does China town ********* mean to   you ******* ** ********* ******* ** and  How is it important to   you ******* ** and  then you ***** tell us who you are? You  know what ****** your relationship  is and  then and then *** tell us ******* ** ********* ******* ** you want to  start surely who  Is    is  involved so tell us about who you  are and then  what and answer the  questions     You didn't        do     it. Okay Yeah,    my ** name is Shirley will Actually, I was born in  Washington    DC and my involvement in China      town is because I'm the director of the China      town service  center Which is part of the Chinese community church The *** only Chinese community church in Washington    DC we like to  say and actually the reason I'm here is  because another  lady    Was unable to make  it and she really was born and worked in China      town for many  years And she had one of the first stores in China      town that's doing in existence  today Anyway, I'm here *** to be part of this  panel and they tell you that China      town is very meaningful to  me even though I was born in    DC and then my parents used to come to China      town when we were quite  young and At that time it was a lot different. It was a lot smaller        a lot  quieter And it was a way for people to meet people like themselves   to speak their  languages to have a cup of  tea To go over old news about what was happening in  China What was going on in  America and I think it's important to me because it is a  community even though We think of it as maybe just a place People come to eat or it's a touristy  place But there are real residents that live  there and it's important. I  think to maintain  that ****** *** ***** *** ******** My name is Walter Wu. I'm Shirley's            husband and I also Help at the Chinatown service center, which is a part of the Chinese Community  Church Which is located in the heart of Chinatown.       This    is that's where we  worship I am an    ABC and American born Chinese. I was born in  Texas a transplant here in  1972 And in San Antonio, we didn't have a  Chinatown and I think for that reason I have a Special  appreciation if not a greater appreciation of  Chinatown even though the one in    DC It's quite  small as  compared let's  say to the ones in New York or San Francisco or Los  Angeles We tutor immigrants with  their help them improve their  English on Saturday   morning We have a  program and we also help them with their  citizenship and we know how valuable that the Residents        of fine living in Chinatown  is You  know  we you may go to  Chinatown and it may have shrunk In terms of the commercial  Chinatown in terms of the number of  restaurants But I think you will  see    you find a significant number of Chinese that live  there They they live  in mainly in three public housing projects Located not that far from the heart of  Chinatown So I think  the when we help Not just ourselves, but we have  other  two ** have one of our  tutors  actually who's  here who's been a  longtime tutor At our Saturday  program and I think the reward that we get is that when we help Immigrants improve their English or help them in some  way we can see the smile on their  face We can see the  appreciation and we can see the gratitude that they  have and  Chinatown What it  is  it's it provides an instant a community for the Chinese to Fellowship ********** with other Chinese and with similar  language So it's  really ** a very key part in helping assimilate into this  country ******* ** ** So my name     is Ted  Gong I'm I'm from California  and everybody's using these terms     ABC ******* ** and I'm      ABC and American-born  Chinese but as you guys all know  probably there's  always  like      HIP * Hong Kong instant  product   MIT made **** in  Taiwan all that kind of stuff like this,   but  ABC      and when I  I'm ******** about a fourth or fifth       generation Chinese from  California from  Fresno Anybody from  Fresno anybody know Fresno?     Fresno     and ***** ******* *** we of course didn't have a Chinatown  there and the Chinatown that we always go to is either San  Francisco  primarily or to Los  Angeles     and You know the ***** *** thing about growing up in the rural California  is I think there's probably like one or two other Chinese families in my  town Mostly we   pick I was just talking with somebody about picking Cotton ********* you  know *** the long cotton bags and you    drag the cotton bags and    do things like  this But you would always ** my mom and dad ran a grocery store in in        a little tiny grocery store in Rosie,  California near Dainuba, California, which is there Fresno, but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always say we've    got    to go to  Daifu  Daifu San Francisco  Chinatown You have to go back to buy the  groceries to get to talk to the to the family  folk to have the  banquets to have the  weddings and so    For so Chinatown has that meaning as well. It is a place in which you rejuvenate In many  levels  one to get the groceries that you can't get in rural,  California to get the food    or the  banquet that familiar  taste to Talk with those  relatives to have those banquets and those  meals and so  forth  Chinatown  Historically and this   DC         China has had that same  Purpose has Changed    over       originally a place for immigrants to come       Still is a place for immigrants to  come to get the  skills the  language get used to the  America  America so that they can go off and do better things      in  Before Chinatown has other  purposes during the exclusion acts ** we talk about the 1882 exclusion act Chinatown's        are **** actually a protective  place You  know in  8200 ***** and so forth if you were Chinese in Rural ***** part of California during the time when the Chinese exclusion acts was going  on the explosion  period you could be  killed You  know and Chinatown was a protective  enclave That is the place where Chinatown's gather together *** protect  themselves in  California just to let you  know After the exclusion  acts and the period which they call the Expulsion  period There were officially 200  roundups of  Chinese rural  Chinese   Kick out of the  areas or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge Chinese from the  districts and      Chinatown   function as a  place a Protective  place later  on it becomes a place where immigrants get  skills later  on it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the  community like in   DC  here The original   DC Chinatown  here does anybody know where the original   DC Chinatown  was   is  a federal  triangle The original Chinatown was   a federal  triangle and it's expect         it was then pushed off to where it is now And it's now constricted to where it  is so it continues to  evolve But there      is something about Chinatown that is different. There is a sense that Chinatown Is a place where you can get  identity it's linked with Chinese         American identity. It's linked with our  Culture it's linked with a desire to go  back like  myself To find those things which make up our culture and our  identity Chinatown can be a concept as well as a  place    very good very  good **** ***** So yeah, I think  all all three of  you what you said is *** you know, right  on It's ***** it's  different There's different views of what Chinatown  is ******* ** and again I'm gonna ** quote from this book  here because I think it has some great quotes in  it  here  The truth is that Chinatown is a space of  self-invention ******* ** The oldest Chinese  immigrants  including but not limited  to those who landed in the port cities of New  York San  Francisco Los  Angeles  Honolulu ******* ** had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at  large ******* ** These  days new immigrants continue to come for a new  life and a search for   and a search for a cultural identity    Brings Chinese         Americans of many generations back to walk alongside   them ******* ** And I  guess you  know I kind    of   fall in that latter category about looking for myself       identity because ** ******** you  know What Chinatown means to me  is you know, I feel good  there for some reason,     you know *** ***** I can't explain it  because you  know my upbringing was was such that I Grew up in  Mississippi like so   Jen  said during the  40s and   50s during extremely a bad time  there   Where ** ***** I **** ** was just not fun being Chinese, you know, we were picked  on we were  abused And we couldn't go to schools with anybody  else    We **** had to build a one-room schoolhouse ******* ** for us where we had all of our      All the families in the city of Greenville in one school       house  and  house all 12 grades with one  teacher ******* ** So, you know   for      that was kind of life. **** I was brought up  with and so I said, hey, it's no fun being  Chinese ******* ** I'm not gonna ** be Chinese. So  I You know, **** I literally rejected my  heritage ran away from it, you know,   try to forget who I  was     and and ******** so My long journey back       so I'm on    a journey of self-discovery  now because  I ****** **** think I've come  back You know, I'm proud to be Chinese         American  now and it's part of and     Chinatown's a part of   my    Help ** ****** me in finding myself identity and that            and that's         I think that's a very key part of What why we're espousing what       the importance of Chinatown's  here for  me because there's **** a personal  journey I think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community and so, you know,          I would like to  ask You know, Walter and Shirley,     you know You  know as you grew up, you know, maybe you're growing up wasn't as drastic as  mine        You ******* ** * ***** ********* know, I didn't handle it  well me **** *** probably  handle it the better than I  did  but you know, so how did that influence you know how you *** review Chinatown's now and  And you know, what was it mean?     You're growing up,     even though you didn't grow up in a  Chinatown   Yeah, ** **** ******* ** ********* ***** **** *** ** ******* ** ***** *** **** I grew up in   DC ** Actually, *** we had a laundry in southeast  near     I      guess over the  bridge Pennsylvania  Avenue And at that  time in the schools I went  to Elumentary and even Miller School. There weren't that many  Asians So of course I    was stood out    There'll    be  like *** ***** maybe one other girl who might be  Chinese and then she moved away Not *** be only Asian person  there and my friends were always to be amazed at the beginning of school year How teachers would always remember my name, but of course, you know, I was the only person who was  Asian You know ***** had black  hair black  eyes or  whatever So I was     I'm ** aware that I'm Chinese. I'm different from my Caucasian friends, even  though They probably didn't look at me that way, which was  good But I always knew that I was different, you know, my food was different at  home I didn't eat sandwiches like they did.   We *** ***** ** always had rice at  lunchtime You know, it was just different, you know, I had to stay  in  and  we  know we had a  laundry and you  know *** their parents Living ** a  house and so my dream  was someday *** that I was gonna have a house  too and have and be like that dick and Jane  book And have a dog and a  cat and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay  home     anyway  We ******* ** do have a  house so I did   look be able to lift this American  dream But yeah, I'm always aware that I'm  Chinese and Chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to To meet their  friends again, you  know to  talk to meet people of their same languages and     that's that's always important for  everybody ******* ** ******** ***** Well, my background was entirely different.       I ** I grew up in  Texas   actors * *** born in San  Antonio  Were the major population Hispanic ********* ******* ** so there really weren't that many Chinese there and     so      it You know, we    did      what Chinese food we ate was was From my mother's cooking at  home basically,         you *** know, so we didn't have a  Chinatown ******* ** or anything like  that   We visit relatives for Chinese ******** and so  forth and that was about the extent of the Chinese  population ******* ** So when I came to Washington,   DC to work in  1972   end up staying because I met my wife here, ******* ** but I remember when I Visited New York City for the first time during Chinese New  Year ******* ** I was just so mesmerized by the number of Chinese In New York Chinatown, ******* ** I  mean to  me it was so impressive to see so many Chinese  There       I Was thrilled to  death  really       I ** I never experienced something like that. So it's great       really     it    It's     a it's a great thrill, you  know to be among other Chinese and to see         Go into a Chinatown ******* ** where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so  forth and they're all were so  thriving  really so it really was an eye-opening experience for  me and it's something that I always will appreciate and even though the   DC Chinatown is relatively small, ******* ** but I think We both love  it in terms of trying to we identify  Sure,           my wife Shirley and  I you know, we're first       generation. We're born  here So we identify very much with what the immigrants are going  through and so our church has a Chinatown service center That caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth. So we both are  very very involved with  that We have a program that where we tutor Immigrants with their English and help them with their citizenship. So for both of  us  has been  very very  rewarding ******* ** So I  mean so what what is the aura about Chinatown  and makes Chinatown a Chinatown,        you know    as  as So, you know, what is it? We're talking a lot of intangibles here.     It seems like   but a lot of real stuff too  But but there are lots of intangibles. Would you say  that  read that ***** Ted?   Yeah, so   So *** ** I hope that there  is actually I hope that other people can contribute some ideas *********** as  well the idea of a Chinatown is where the   what I remember one person one time somebody asked  me he says that he  says  Why should we     should we ** should we not preserve Chinatown? This is actually a Boston urban  planner Chinatown     urban planner      and he says, you know, that's a bit That's a philosophical question If you ask me how do you preserve Chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and The constructions and the  sites and so  forth Well, that's a question I can answer as an engineer or a  designer But if you ask me should we or should we not preserve Chinatown? Then that's a question of a lot philosophical question and I'm not sure all of us have the right answer to  that Another person said to  me that  says Chinatown is where the Chinese people  are if that's the  case Then if you use the   DC example, **** there are not that many Chinese residents  Physically people living in Chinatown anymore many more are moving toward Rockville. Everybody knows  that if you're *** talking about where the food  is There are good Chinese restaurants in Chinatown There are others and even more than other places          in Maryland  in different places of this sort  They in New York you talk about not just one Chinatown  a Mott  Street You talk about three or four Chinatowns because the different congregations of people and their restaurants have  moved in  Philadelphia the restaurants have moved and so forth and and so  on so what is it that makes  Chinatown Chinatown and where things  are Think about it  again right now. There are more Chinese festivals being done in the urban area.    So you have these big festivals being done say at Tyson's Corner or Oak ** at one of the malls    and they have these great dances all day long for Chinese New Year or   for Qingming and You  will go there and everybody  will celebrate those things and learn a little bit *** eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about Chinese  culture But you would never say that Tyson's Corner or Fair Oaks Mall is Chinatown      Which you would never say that right    but and you would have a hard time saying just because there's a Concentration of people in  Rockville that Rockville is Chinatown. There's something about that term Chinatown In these historical Chinatowns that make makes   it what it is and I'm not sure what it is. It's *** ******* ** ***** ***** a      yes Yes Yes   Yes,         so *** ******* ** **** **** *** but at the same time    So he is  saying that how do you How how do you keep a Chinatown in the country ** * ******* **** ** as diverse as the United States is? That raises another interesting  question Everybody  else other ethnic groups have their own  barrios their own fishermen's   war for something ** this  sort should all those Places be preserved separately as we  grow We ** ***** ** remember that I was raised and  say a part of New York  City But I don't necessarily want to maintain that  area if I were raised in the projects in  Detroit That's defined my character and  stuff But I don't        want this or preserve  that that that that  building  right but why is it then that do we want to preserve    a Chinatown  area do we have any answers to that?   Yeah, ** **** who has answers to that? You know my own my own answer Somewhat        is I agree. I mean it     is it's hard when to  answer  But you  know I'm saying that you know what I what I read what I read  earlier is that that Chinatown You know has his own deeply filled history and stories of  national cultural significance And I think one of the things about Chinatown is it was a protective Area for us as opposed to you     know this is where we had to be and I think you know there's lots of stories there that need to be preserved You       know if  not the structures of  themselves Then the stories that go behind know why these China why were Chinatowns there? I think that's ** important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about you know why were  these Why did that the the Chinese population? Retreat into these Chinatowns and         and and they got the reputation             It's not because that you know they wanted to per se  But but then they were they were kind of forced into that area and they persevered there And I think that's how they became a stronger community It made for a sense of community and I think that that kind of history is  there I don't know. I don't know if you disagree or not agree with me Walter or        So     you so part of the community is part of it is the  community the current community  there the   historic  community But part of it is sort of the Hollywood myth of Chinatown        Who you  know you have Chinatown movies you  have  everybody you talk about the for better or  worse Whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like  this Chinatown evokes an image that I think  other other I think communities don't necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for the Chinese Americans.  Yeah Immersion ** ****** and culture ******** *********** I think that's What       why **** **** *** **** ***** ***** is ****** **** *** **** that ***** ** ***** **** *** ***** ** * ***** ***** ************ ******* ****** *** *** *** ***** ******* ****** *** so * ***** ****** **** ********* **** *** ***** ***** **** ** * ******* ****** ****** *** ***** **** **** **** ***** ** ******* ** **** ******** ******* ** ******* ** ********* ** ***** *** one of the things she's saying is  that growing up Oklahoma ********* you come back much like Stan is  saying or Walter is  saying you come in and suddenly you surround it  by Things ****** that your  parents or  grandparents  or that kind    of stuff that happens      and *** that gives you another sense of Part * **** of your identity  in  history But why is that  that you get that from a  Chinatown and not from say **** going to the Chinese Historical Museum in New  York or the  Inju Island  Museum   and why is it that it's a  Chinatown      that does  that that  place? ******** ************* ** ******* ** ***** ***** I think it's just an aura  there       that does  that because     I agree That what you're saying there because      you   know, I don't speak Chinese      You    know  so     you know people say they go to Chinese because they *** hear people speaking they're saying      like I don't understand a word That's being said  there   by Chinese people there  since     so you    know and  I  can say ***** I ran away from my Chinese  heritage   So I   really don't  identify but  somehow when I'm there, you     know, I feel like   hey staying your home  And something  is   it  you   know, I use the  term   is a cultural touchstone for  me  In ** my personal journey and I think it I think that resonates with lots *** of people like me Who who've had us who've kind of run away from their identity or *** not sure what their identity is because the duality that  we Chinese Americans face in this country, you know, you know living especially second generation people like  us  They're        a generation *********** ***** *********** fourth generation.   Yeah. Yeah, ***** **** I think for those who Chinese Americans who are born here You know, we may tend to view Chinatown more ** in the abstract as Something that has enduring meaning      and I think it does Because it's it's a part of our history and so forth But I but I think there's ** another level which is much more basic and * ***** that is for the immigrants  who come You know, they seek comfort in like kind  language  in other people who've **** had experiences just like them and so it To me, it's it's it's very very basic  really It's security for immigrants    who come and I think when you find someone who is sharing Somewhat the same experience that you're *** about to embark on it provides a tremendous Amount of comfort and security So in even in   DC Chinatown when we look at it, we may find that it seemed to be relatively small But really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants I think it means so much to them And I think we see that in our interaction at the Chinatown service  center the immigrants  who come in for help Sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for  translation   to get something in the mail They **** don't know what this is so you  can I think what we always try to do is put put ourselves in an immigrants  place Imagine if you were to go to China and know not a word of Chinese and then how would you  cope and so? I think that is the attitude that we take when we Assist immigrants who come to the Chinatown service center seeking  help Sounds ** ****** like That's that's   a real toughy Kirk  You know    she's    asking ***** ******* ******* ** **** ******* ********** ********* ** you know how       do how  do we *** ******** ********* *** ***** *** **** *** ********* *** ******* **** *** ********* **** ****** ******* ****** *** ******** ********** ******** ********** ********* **** ********* ******* ** ****** * **** ******* **** ** you know  I announced **** *** ** ** *** the question? I really want to present here as sort of our  assignment you  know how how do we do this? How how do we maintain because ***** you're not gonna    you're  not you   know DC Chinatown? It's not gonna ** have a lot of residents again You   know and  like like San Francisco where you're selling fish you know on the open market there and things like that and and a lot of people living there and speaking the language in Chinese and in dialects and so  forth so That's a hard one to  answer you  know how do we preserve this this feeling here and preserve  this most of  all the history That's been there and and the and the people who  live  there   play  their    life and   cry there * the whole  thing       so  so So part part of it  is you do have to maintain the physical appearance of the  time that boundaries   to define  it whether it's the  Architecture the   little whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another   question But there's something that allows it to be  distinct so in DC Chinatown for  example shops have to have Chinese characters on their  windows  Right and  so those kind of things seem  superficial But they are still important enough to help define that  space then what you do in that space is  important What are the activities that you do  there do you allow the family? Associations to continue to operate  there does the city given enough           a family  association Talking ******* very much about the    Lee  association the more you're associated           on    long and things of these  sorts these things Don't have the original purpose that they have in the sense  that Everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke  Chinese Chinese nights  be English ******** and they did a lot of  extra or  Judiciary or sort of semi      judiciary  type of  functions But they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they  do Chinese  Consolidate benevolent association still represents 30        some odd associations of Chinese people and organizations * they do annually the Chinese New Year  parade those type of things are important still to  do and We should have the  city and continue to encourage  that the  building space does      it have Places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which    tan is talking  about So if the people have or      have gone  there and lived  there and have a story to tell and we ought to have a way to His preserve  it and then to     once we preserve   it to tell it so that the next generation or other  people Not just the next generation  Chinese But other people  who are passing through a giant      town know that there are stories created in China      town that represented the Chinese  Identity or diaspora that happened to be in  DC You *** had another  question ******** ******* *** ****** ******* ** Yes       I  I Correct ** ************** *** ******** ** ********* **** and **** ** *** ******* ********** *** ******* ****** ** *** **** ***** **** **** *** ****** ****** *** ******* **** ******* ********** ** ******** ** *** ** ** **** ** ***** * **** **** **** **** *** **** ********** ********** ***** ** **** ********** ***** ******* ********** ** ********* **** *** ****** *** *** **** ** ** ******* **** ****** *** ********* ** ** * *** **** ****** **** **** *** *** ****** *** *** ** ** **** ********* ******** ******* ** ******** *** so one of the issues  there that very much is on top of everybody's  mind if you think about China      town and what makes it It's the individual  entrepreneurs the mom and pop  shops the little things like that   to sell the chashu    bow and the all that kind of stuff Did you that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up? There's ** no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so forth like  this And at a certain point those people that operate those businesses **** my mom and dad   or somebody they're getting old and quite frankly They worked really hard to get you in college So you *** get that law degree  right and you're *** not gonna ** go back there and run that place So those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things   as us  who have looking at property As the development China, ***** how do we encourage? Something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed. It's already gone by  right  so So I'm not sure what the real answer is to  that It could be city. Maybe the city has to produce some kind *** of Tax incentive that allows these things to  stay  but do you really want to do that? Do you really want to encourage a small business that  doesn't that doesn't really make itself productive? Or do you have ** ordinance **** say there should be an Asian related ** Chinese? Those are all questions for us practically   today my my feeling just to finish off is that I  think I think what? We many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. I would like to see Big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there It allows us to do those things that make our Chinese life  significant the  wedding  the the moon you     The the   Qingming Festival or something where you bring your family  there You have to create  so it's not so much that small definition of a shop But it is a Chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your  activities   Yeah, so well, yeah, we're almost at the end of our time. So we get closing comments  here       It *********** ** **** * ** * ***** **** ** is difficult to have small businesses. It's just not profitable It also I think housing is also a problem. That's why people cannot paint afford to live  there We have all these expensive condominiums *************** Unless you  have   a little a high  income It seems impossible.  So but we do have people who do want to live  there They want to raise their families  there and there's no affordable  housing and low-income housing  seem to be disappearing  too  So there's all sorts of problems and I really don't know really what can be  done  really ******* ** Yeah, my fear is that what we're gonna ** end up having in DC    Because of the gentrification and so forth       is that what    we ***** ** end up having is just a commercial  Chinatown Where we have very few residents Living  there and that would be a real shame really, you  know,      we I think in Las  Vegas They have what they   call a Chinatown in a  mall To  me that is not a  Chinatown  really and I think it's incumbent upon the city to Provide affordable housing right     now. There's three buildings that     are affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping  block Because because it's such a hot area. They want to turn that into a  condominium  So I don't ****** know what the answer is basically        but I think at the very least what we know we need is an infusion of capital with Because you   know, we have to put traffic   in         the   air the area is is really a hot area  now But we need some entrepreneurs with some Chinese connections who's willing to invest in the  area right now We have we have this         is like  Panera Starbucks. They're all coming  in but the Chinese  entrepreneurs I  think are unwilling to make the  investment   Okay, very good. Yeah, ***** I think I agree with all that and you know that   the one point that I did want to Emphasize on yours  that you know, we I certainly don't want it to be a commercial Chinatown Yeah, I don't want to we don't       know none of us want a Disneyland atmosphere there We're just for tourists to come in there and gawk at the Chinese people  there and that's not that's not a Chinatown You      know, we want it to be meaningful. I think what they're saying is right. We're gonna  have to help help from the city planners To bring in the right businesses and and to make the right conditions there to make it work Excuse     me,     but     so  so we're coming to the end  here  So again, I want I want to read again from from this quote here because I think it's very significant that what what what? Bonnie Suey says in this book here says,   you know, the myth of America lies in its patchwork  heritage Though the United States hasn't always tolerated  difference it continues           to this day     to be built by immigrants The         cut this contradiction is in founding myths led to an ethnic  awakening the birth of cultural pride that is still  evolving Visitors in Chinatown have a role.     You all have a role      just as residents do in the bartering of cultural  currency If there's authenticity to be  experienced It's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. It's ** a reminder of what makes America special and And       so after a century and a half of Chinese  immigration Chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into America and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese  heritage And so   I thank you all for your attention  today And I think  Ted  Walter and and Shirley for their participation  here And  really I said you guys got a year   of     silence   then you   help us  out   help us with  Chinatowns You  know make it make it work for us here. We're make it work for you, too.

      "REF: speaker 1: hello, hello  everyone we're getting set up for our next session in teahouse commons.   speaker 1: you are in the china program of the 2014 smithsonian folklife festival. speaker 1: this program is presented through a collaboration by the center for folklife and cultural heritage at the smithsonian with the china international cultural association, working with the china arts and entertainment group in beijing. speaker 1: thanks a lot for being here. today i don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different today. speaker 1: the china festival program actually brought over 120 artists and presenters from china to participate in this program. speaker 1: but today    we are doing something a little bit different, we're calling it \"diaspora day\". speaker 1: there are about    4 million people of chinese ancestry in the united states, and today we're celebrating the way in which when people move, how they transform and adapt culture, community, and traditions to the new ****** places where they end up. speaker 1: so today this **** session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is * apart of the diaspora day programming, which is also co-produced with the smithsonian ***** asian-pacific american center. speaker 1: so we have um today's session right now that   that we're getting ready to start is the 1882 foundation talk story on the mall, and we are going to be talking about ***** **** chinatown today, chinatown today is the subject of this session. speaker 1: and i'm going to go ahead and introduce to you stan liu, who is going to do the presenting and *** moderating of this session with our **** *** experts here today, our local experts. speaker 1: i want to first introduce you to stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 foundation. [silence] speaker 1: so stan liu, sitting right here to my left, is a retired civil engineer. he used to work for the federal aviation administration, and he went to china for the first time in 2003. speaker 1: 2003, he spent two years *** *****   there teaching chinese at a university, and when he came back to the us he became very interested and committed with working with chinese american organizations. speaker 1: stan is himself a native of greenville, mississippi, which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic, um, but stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of chinese americans, as well as the 1882 foundation. speaker 1: and for those of you who don't know, the 1882 foundation is a non-partisan, non-profit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of chinese exclusion laws, speaker 1: and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep chinese immigrants out of the united states and ** prevent those who were here already from ever attaining citizenship. speaker 1: so    they have been doing really wonderful work around the country um and i'm now going to turn it over to stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel. speaker 2: ok, thank you sojin, speaker   2: hey! speaker 2: it's a pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and uh we're-and this is diaspora day, like ** sojin was saying here, and we're gonna, i'm gonna introduce everybody here speaker 2:    and we're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are  'cause i don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over credentials that ** really don't matter. speaker 2: you know, what we say is what's gonna be important. speaker 2: so [silence] speaker 2: so this is diaspora day and you know, and you know, the epitome of diasporas in the united states of course are chinatowns, speaker 2: and that's ****** what we think about when when *******    we talk   about displaced chinese *** *** away from china in the united states, speaker    2: chinatowns are the first things that come to my mind, and *** ***   so when we put out our flyer, you know we said **** *** that-that, uhh, we're gonna talk about ***** chinatown today, and uh, but this is not gonna to be a ****** travelogue, by any ****** means. speaker 2: we're gonna talk about what ***** chinatown means to us, and uh, because like we said in the ***** flyer, chinatown has different meanings to different people, speaker 2: and one of the references i have is this book called ******** ùòàùòÆùò¶ùò≥ùò™ùò§ùò¢ùòØ ùòäùò©ùò™ùòØùò¢ùòµùò∞ùò∏ùòØùò¥ written by bonnie tsui; and so i'll just read briefly what she says about, you know, chinatown usa. speaker 2: \"a state of mind, a world within a world, a neighbourhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine, every day   speaker 2: [silence] speaker 2: \"americans find something different in chinatown.\" speaker   2: \"its a place as foreign, yet familiar, by now quite well known on the western-cultural   radar, speaker 2: but splitting the difference still gives many visitors to ***** chinatown the sense above all, that things are not speaker 2: [silence] speaker 2: \"what they seem, and   [uhh] popular cultural's been telling us this for decades, and it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm.\" speaker 2: \"a place with its own deeply felt history and stories of national-cultural significance.\"       speaker 2: so, you know, our panel today is going to talk about, you know, what this means to ** the apa community,    uhh, chinese-american community from our viewpoint, speaker        2: and then we don't, we won't agree on ********** ******* everything, 'cause, as you, as those of you who are, uhh, chinese americans or chinese, know **** that, y'know, there's very, speaker 2: we argue a lot. speaker 2: so we have differences of opinion about what ***** chinatown means to us and we have, and certainly the three panellists here all, we all, have our own opinions about it, and uh, speaker 2: but one thing that, you know, and i also want you and the audience to be thinking about it ** too, \"what does ***** chinatown mean to you?\" speaker 2: and you know, that's ***** gonna be your     take away for today is come out of this **** session here, real uh, thinking about what ***** chinatown means speaker 2: when you ** go, about, if you're here in the dc area, go to dc ***** chinatown, and say you know, what does it mean, to you, and you know, what-and-and,   cause it's changing every day. speaker    2: chinatowns, and so are  those of you from out of town, go back to your hometowns and *** look at *** these chinatowns there, and what   do they mean to you? speaker     2: that's-that's your assignment **** from-coming from the day, but, so our, our group here, one thing we have in  common i ***** think, is-is that we, we all are all, abcs. speaker 2: that's american born chinese. speaker 2: so you know, we, uh, have that perspective **** that-that, we aren't, we-we're born in this  country so we are americans, but we're   also, but we're really, definitely chinese americans. speaker 2: we're all active in ** the dc ***** chinatown, and we do participate in our talk story events that we have, in ***** chinatown, every month. speaker 2: where we gather the community together to-to share stories of our experiences as growing up as chinese americans, asian americans, speaker 2: you know and what that means, in and you know, we have this monthly in ** ***** chinatown and so if you want, if you're ********** interested, if you're in the area, you know, talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are going to be. speaker 2: but for today, it's ***** chinatown, i-i, it's-it's, talk story on the mall, and so i'm gonna, the way we're gonna introduce ****     each, ourselves, is-i'm gonna go down here and *** ask the question, you know, speaker   2: \"what does chinatown mean to you\", speaker 2: [silence] speaker 2: and \"how is it important to you?\" speaker 2: and then, you know, tell us who you are, you know,  and what's your relationship is, and then, and then uh, tell us speaker 2: [silence] speaker 2: you want to start, shirly wu, uh, is-is involved, so tell us about who you are, and **** what, and answer the questions. speaker     2: [silence] shirley  wu:    ah yeah. my name is shirley  wu,  actually i was born in washington, d.c., and my involvement in ***** chinatown is because i'm the director of the ***** chinatown service center, which is part of the chinese community church -- the only chinese community church in washington d.c., we like to say! and actually the reason i'm here is because, another lady, wasn't   able to make it, and she really was born and worked in ***** chinatown for many years, and she had one of the first stores in ***** chinatown that's still in existence today. anyway, i'm here to, to be part of this panel, and   to tell you that ***** chinatown is very meaningful to me, even though i was born in d.c., and then my parents used to come to ***** chinatown when we were quite young, and at that time it was a lot different, it was a lot ******* smaller, lot quieter, and it was a way for people to meet people like themselves that speak their languages, to have a cup of tea, to go over all news about what was happening in china, what was going on in america. and i think it's important to me because it is a community, even though we think of it as maybe just a place people come to eat or   as a touristy place, but there are real residents that live there, and it's important, i think, to maintain that. walter wu: thank you shirley. my name is walter wu, i'm shirley's husband,[[laughs]] and i also help at the chinatown service center, which is a part of the chinese community church, which is located in the heart of ********** chinatown, it's, that's where we worship. i am an a.b.c,  an american born chinese. i was born in texas, a transplant here in 1972, and in san antonio, we didn't have a chinatown. and i think for that reason i have a special appreciation, if not a greater appreciation of chinatown. even though the one in d.c., it's quite small, as compared, let's say, to the ones in new york or san francisco or los angeles. we tutor immigrants with their, help them improve their english; on saturday mornings, we have a program, and we also help them with their citizenship, and we know how valuable that the residents ** find living in chinatown is. you know, we, you may go to chinatown, it, it may have shrunk in terms of the commercial chinatown, in terms of the number of restaurants, but i think you will see, you'll find a significant number of chinese that live there. they **** live in, mainly in three public housing projects located not that far from the heart of chinatown. so i think the, when we help not just ourselves, but we have others too, we have one of our tutors, actually, who's here, who's been a long-time tutor at our saturday program, and i think the reward that we get is that when we help immigrants improve their english or help them in some way, we can see the smile on their face, we can see the appreciation, and we can see the gratitude that they have. and chinatown, what it is, it's, it provides an instant * community for the chinese to do fellowship with other chinese and with similar language, so it's really, a, a very key part in helping assimilate into this country. speaker 1: um so my **** name's ted gong. i'm *** from california and, everybody's using these terms 'a.b.c' speaker 1: and i'm 'a.b.c.' and american-born chinese, but as you guys all know probably, there's always, like, 'h.i.p.' - hong kong instant product, m.i.t -- made in taiwan, all that kind of stuff like ***** this! but, a.b.c.-- when i s--i was--i'm about a fourth or ***** fifth-generation chinese from california, from fresno. anybody from fresno? anybody know fresno? [[laughs]] anyway, rural fresno. and we of course didn't have a chinatown there, and the chinatown that we always go to is either san francisco, primarily, or to los angeles. speaker 1: and, you know? the thing about growing up in *** rural california is, i think there's probably like one or two other chinese families in my town; mostly we pick-- i was just talking with  someone about picking   gr-- --cotton, you know, and the long cotton bags and you dragged the cotton bags and doing things like this. but you would always -- my mom and dad ran a grocery ***** ** ** store--a little tiny grocery store in orosi, california, near   dinuba california, which is  near fresno. but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always ***  say, 'we've gotta go to taifu, taifu, san francisco chinatown. you have to go back to buy the groceries, to get to talk to the ** *** family folk, to have the banquets, to have the weddings, and so forth. so chinatown has that meaning as well. it is a place in which you rejuvenate in many levels. one, to get the groceries that you can't get in  rural california. to get the **** food, the banquet, that familiar taste. to talk with those relatives, to have those banquets and those meals, and so forth. chinatown, historically, and this d.c. china[[town]] has had that same purpose, has changed **** over--originally a place for immigrants to **** come--still is a place for immigrants to come; to get the skills, the language, get used to the america, america, so that they can go off and do better ****** things. before, chinatown has other purposes. during the exclusion  act -- we talk about the 1882 exclusion act          -- chinatowns were actually a protective place. you know, in 1882, 1800s and so forth if you were chinese in a rural part of california during the time when the chinese exclusion acts was going on, the expulsion period, you could be killed, you know? and chinatown was a protective enclave. that is the place where  chinatowns gather together and protect themselves. in california, just to let you know, after the exclusion acts, and the period which they call the expulsion period, there were officially 200 round-ups of chinese, rural chinese, kicked out of the areas, or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge chinese from the districts.  so china[[towns]] functioned as a place, a protective place. later on, it becomes a place where immigrants get skills. later on, it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the community, like in d.c. here. the original d.c. chinatown here, does anybody know where the original d.c. chinatown was? it's at federal triangle! the original chinatown was the federal triangle, and it's ****** expand--it was then pushed off to where it is now and it's now constricted to where it is. so it continues to evolve. but ***** there's something about chinatown that is different. there is a sense that chinatown is a place where you can get identity. it's linked with ******* chinese-american identity, it's linked with our culture, it's linked with a desire to go back, like myself, to find those things which make up our culture and our identity. chinatown can be a concept as well as a place. speaker 2: very good. very good. so yeah, i think that all three of you, what you said is is, you know, right on,  you know, it's different, there's different views of what chinatown is, speaker 2: and again i'm going to quote from this book here, because i think it has some great quotes in it, here. 'the truth is that chinatown is a space of self-invention. speaker 2: the oldest chinese immigrants, including, but not limited to, those who landed in the port cities of new york, san francisco, los angeles, honolulu, speaker 2: had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large. speaker 2: these days, new immigrants continue to come for a new life, and a search for --and a search for a cultural identity, brings ******* chinese-americans of many generations back to walk alongside them.' speaker 2: and i guess, you know, i **** kinda follow in that latter category about looking for     my self-identity, speaker 2: because, you know, what chinatown means to me is, you know, i feel good there, for some reason. speaker 2: you know, i can't explain it because, you know, my upbringing was *** such that i grew up in mississippi, like ** sojin said, during the '40s and '50s, during extremely a bad time there, speaker 2: where i --it it was just not fun being chinese! you know, we were picked on, we were abused, and we couldn't go to schools with anybody else, where they had to build a one-room schoolhouse speaker 2: for us where we had all of *** our--all the families in the city of greenville in one ****** schoolhouse that housed all 12 grades with one teacher. speaker 2: so, you **** know, for--that was kind of   the life i was brought up with, and so i said,  hey it's no fun being chinese, speaker 2: i'm not going to be chinese. so i, i, you  know i literally rejected my heritage, ran away from it, you know, tried to forget who i was, speaker  2: and--and so my long journey **** back--so i'm on this journey of self-discovery now, speaker 2: 'cause i--i think i've come back, you know, i'm proud to be ******* chinese-american now, and it's part ** *** of--chinatown's a part of my-- speaker 2: helped me in finding     my self-identity. and **** *** ****** that's--i think that's a very key part of **** why we're espousing **** what--the importance of chinatowns, here. for me, speaker      2: it's a personal journey, i think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community *** *** *** ***** and--so--i would like to ask, you know, walter and shirley, speaker   2: you know, as you grew up, you know, maybe   your growing up wasn't as drastic as mine, [[laughs]] speaker 2: i don't know--you know, i didn't handle it well,  i mean you probably handled it *** better than i did, but, you know, so how did that influence *** **** how you you review  chinatowns now *** and, you know,  why  is it ***** mean--your growing *** up--even though you didn't grow up in a chinatown? speaker 1: ah-- speaker 1: [[shirley woo]] it's not as drastic as that! ah, yeah i grew up in d.c. um actually, ah, we had a laundry in ********* south east, near--just over the bridge, pennsylvania avenue. and at that time, in the schools i went to, elementary and even middle school, there weren't that many asians, so of course i always stood out [[laughs]]. there would be, like, maybe one other girl who might be chinese, and then she moved away and i'd be only asian person there. and my friends were always ** be amazed at the beginning of school year how teachers would always remember my name! but of course, you know, i was the only person who was asian, who you know, had black hair, black eyes, or whatever. so i was always, am aware that i'm chinese, i'm different from my caucasian friends, even though, they probably didn't look at me that way, which was good! but i always knew that i was different, you know. my food was different at home. i didn't eat sandwiches like they  did and, you know, we always had rice at lunchtime, you know. it was just different, you know. i had to stay in, and, you know, we had a laundry, and you know, and their parents   live in a house! and so my dream was,    some day that i was gonna have a house too, and **** *** be like that dick and jane book, and have a dog and a cat, and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay home! [[laughs]] but anyway, we do have a house, so i did live-- be able to live this american dream. but yeah, i'm always aware that i'm chinese. and chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to ** meet their friends, again, you know, to talk, to meet people of their same ********* languages. that's ****** always important for everybody. speaker 2: [[walter woo]] well, my background was entirely different. speaker 2: i grew up in texas, actually i was born in san antonio, where the major population       is hispanic, speaker 2: so there really weren't that many chinese ***** *** there. speaker  2:  and, so it--we did--what chinese food we ate was *** from my mother's cooking at home,  basically [[laughs]]. you know, so we didn't have a chinatown, speaker 2: or anything like that. we'd visit relatives who    were chinese, and so forth, and that was about the extent of the chinese population. speaker 2: so when i came to  washington d.c. to work in 1972, ended up staying because i met my wife here, speaker 2: but i remember when i visited new york city for the first time during chinese new year, speaker 2: i was just so mesmerized by the number of chinese in new york chinatown. speaker 2: i mean, to me, it was so impressive to see so many chinese there. i--i--i was thrilled to death, really. speaker 2: i never experienced something like that. so it--it--it's great, really. it's, it's a **** * great thrill, you know, to be among other chinese and to *** see--going   to a chinatown speaker 2: where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth, and    they all were so thriving, really. so it really was an eye-opening experience for me, and it's something that i always will appreciate and even though the d.c. chinatown is relatively small, speaker 2: but i think we both love it, in terms of trying ** ** ******** to--we identify--my wife shirley and i, you know, we're ***** first-generation, we're born here, so we identify very much with what the  immigrant are going through. and so our church has a chinatown service center that caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth. so we both are very, very involved with that. we have a program that where we tutor immigrants with their english and help them with their citizenship. so for both of us, it's been very, very rewarding. speaker 3: so i mean, so what **** is the aura about chinatown that makes chinatown a chinatown? you **** know, as, so, you know, what is it? we're talking a lot of intangibles here, seems, like,  you know, a lot of real stuff too, but *** *****   a  lot of intangibles, would you say that, agree with that, ted? speaker 4: yea, so, so i hope that there is, actually i hope **** other people can contribute   to    my experiences as well. the idea of a chinatown **   is,  is where, i remember one ****** *** time somebody asked me, he **** **** ** says, \"why should ** we..should we or should we not preserve chinatown? this is actually a boston urban planner, a chinatown urban ******* planner, he says,  ya  know that's a *** ****** * philosophical question if you ask me how do  we preserve chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and the constructions and the sights and so forth, well, that's a question i can answer as an engineer or a designer. but if you ask me should we or should we not preserve chinatown, then that's a ******** ** * *** philosophical question and i'm not sure all of us have the right answer to that. another person said to me,    i says, chinatown is where the chinese people are. if that's the case, then if you use the d.c.  example then there are not that many chinese residents physically, people living in chinatown ******* many more are moving toward rockville, everybody knows that. if    you are talking about where the food is, there are good chinese restaurants in chinatown there are others and even more   in other ****** places...in maryland and different places of this **** sort. in new york you talk about not just one chinatown on mott street, you talk about three or four chinatowns because the different congregations of people and   the restaurants have moved. in philadelphia, the restaurants have moved and so forth and *** so on. so what is it that makes chinatown, chinatown and where things are? think about it again. right now, there are more chinese festivals being done in *** urban areas where you have these big festivals being done say at tyson's corner or oak or at one of the ***** malls. they have these great dances all day long for chinese new year or ching     ming and you would go there and everybody would celebrate those things and learn a little bit and eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about chinese culture. but you would never say that tyson's corner or fair oaks mall is ********* chinatown. you would never say **** that, right? and you would have a hard time saying just because there's a concentration of people in rockville, that rockville is chinatown. there's something about that term chinatown in these historical chinatowns that **** makes this what it is and i'm not sure what it is.    [ the speaker is being asked a question but   i cannot understand it] speaker 1: yes, yes, so, but at the same **** time, he is saying, that how do you *** *** ** *** keep a chinatown in the country in a country that is as diverse as the unites states is. that raises another interesting question. everybody else, other  ethic groups have their own barrios, their own fisherman's wharf  or something of this sort. should all those places be preserved separately as we grow. as we grow, we remember that i was raised  in say, a part of new york city, but i don't necessarily want to maintain that area. if i were raised in the projects in detroit, that's defined my character and stuff, but i don't necessarily want to preserve that, that **** **** building, right. but why is it then that ** we want to preserve that chinatown area? do we have any answers to that? speaker 2: yea, who has answers to that? *** **** my own ** *** ******  answers somewhat, i ****** * **** ** agree, it's hard when to answer. but,  ya know, i'm saying that *** **** what i **** * read **** * **** earlier, is that **** chinatown *** **** has its own deeply   felt history and stories of national, cultural significance and i think one ** ***  thing about chinatown is it was a protective area for us as ******* ** *** opposed, this is where we had to be and i think *** **** there's lots of stories there that need to be ********* *** preserved. if not, the structures ** themselves, then the stories that go behind **** why ***** ***** *** were chinatowns there. i think that's an important history lesson for all of us in this country to know ***** *** about. why **** ***** *** did **** the *** chinese  population retreat into these chinatowns? and *** *** they got the ********** reputation..it's not because **** *** **** they wanted to per say, but *** **** they were **** **** kind of forced into that area and they persevered there and i think that's how they became a stronger community it made for a sense of community and i think that **** kind of history is there. i don't ***** * ***** know if you disagree or not agree with me ****** ** walter... speaker 1: part of the community ** part of it is the community, the current community there, the historical community, but part of it is sort of the hollywood myth of ********* chinatown. you know, you have chinatown movies you have, everybody, you talk about the for better or worse, whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this. chinatown evokes an image that i think other, other * ethic communities ***** necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for *** chinese americans, yeah.   speaker 1: [[??]] and culture {speaker name=woman} i  grew     up   in oklahoma, just like you guys where there is nobody else and just that sense of going back and going to a place where historically chinese [[??]] and you see where perhaps [[??]] and so i think thats, it's something that you might could find in a history museum [[??]] you don't have that same sense of feeling or real culture. speaker 1: speaker 1: wh-wh-why is that? so, one of the things she's saying is that, growing up       in oklahoma, you come back much like stan is saying, or walter is saying, you come in and suddenly you surround it by, uh, things that your parents, or grandparents, all that **** kinda stuff that   kinda happens. and that gives you another sense of uh, a part of your identity and history. but why is   it that, you get that from a chinatown, and not from   , say, going to the chinese historical museum in new york, or the angel island museum, in... why is it that it's a chinatown, that-that does that? that place.. {speaker name=\"speaker 2} speaker 2: y=you know, i think it's just an aura there, th-th-that does that,  'cause i-i-i agree that what you're saying there ******* because, y'know, i don't speak ******* chinese, y'know, so, y'know,   so people say they go to   china      so they can hear people speakin'   their   same language- i don't understand a word that's being said there- b-by chinese people ***** there. since, so, y'know, and i- like   i said, i ran away from my chinese heritage. s-so i really.. don't identify, but somehow, when i'm there, *** y-y'know, i feel **** like,   \"hey, stay   in your    home\". uh, and, and, y'know, i use the term, it's a cultural touchstone for me. uh, in my personal journey and i think ** * ***** that resonates with    a lot of people like me *** who've had ** who've kind of run away from their identity or are not sure what their identity is because the duality that we, chinese americans face in this  country you ***** *** know living especially second generation people like us. {speaker name=man         in background} third generation, fourth generation. speaker 1: yeah, yeah i think for those who chinese americans who are born here you  know we may tend to view chinatown more as in the abstract as something that has enduring ******* meaning, i think it does because   it   is a part of our history and so forth but i *** * think   there is another level  that is much more basic and i think that is for the immigrants that come *** ***** they seek comfort in like kind languages and other people    who have had experiences just like them and so it to  me it's it's **** very very basic really. it's security for immigrants who've come and i think when you find someone who is sharing somewhat the same experience that    you are about to embark on it provides a tremendous amount of comfort and security so ** even in d.c. chinatown when we look at  it we may find that it  seems to be relatively small but really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants i think it means so much to them and i think we see that in our interaction at the chinatown service center, the immigrants that come in for help sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation, they get something in the mail and they don't know what this is so you can. i think what we always try to do is put *** ourselves in an immigrants place, imagine if you were to go to china and know not a word of chinese and then how would you cope? and  so i think that is the attitude that we take when we assist immigrants who come to the chinatown service center seeking help. kirk: it sounds like   what    you all  are saying   is that  the physical chinatown keeps getting smaller in many places, washington included. do you have any thoughts on how we can preserve chinatown and maybe not just the physical, but perhaps also the histories that you're talking about, the cultural histories? {unknown background speaker}: good question. speaker 1: that's a real toughie kirk uh you know as       you ask, how do we ask the  question i really want to present here as sort of our assignment, you know, how *** do we do this? how *** do we maintain       - cause you're not going to--we're not, you know-- dc  chinatown   is not going to have a lot of residents again, you **** know, like **** san francisco where you're selling fish *** **** on the open market there and things like that and *** a lot of people living there and speaking the language in chinese and ** dialects and so forth, so that's a hard one to answer, you know, how do we preserve this **** feeling here and preserve this- most of all- the history that's been there and  of the *** *** people who lived there, played there, laughed and cried there - the whole thing? {speaker 2}: so part **** of it is, you ** have to maintain the physical appearance of the town,  the boundaries that define it, whether it's the architecture, the little-- whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another question-- but there's something that allows it to be distinct. so in dc chinatown for example, shops have to have chinese characters on their windows, right? and so, those kind of things seem superficial, but they are still important enough to help define that space.  and what you do in that space is important, what are the activities that you do there? do you allow the  family associations to continue to operate there? does the city  give     it enough--the family associations were talking very much about the [[??]] association, the **** ******     [[??]] association, [[??]], and things of these sorts. these things don't have the original purpose that they  had in the sense that, everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke chinese, chinese    did not   speak english, and they did a lot of extra, or judiciary, or sort of **** semi-judiciary types of functions. but they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do. chinese consolidated benevolent association still represents ** thirty-some odd associations of chinese people and organizations - they do annually the chinese new year parade. those type of things are important still to do, and we should have the city- and continue to encourage that. the buildings space **** doesn't have places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which [[??]] is talking about. so if the people **** ** are--have gone there, and  live there, and have a story to tell  -- we ought to have a way to *** preserve it. and then ** to--once we preserve it-- to tell it so that the next generation or other people, not just *** next generation chinese, but other people that are passing through * ***** chinatown know that there are stories created in ***** chinatown that represented the chinese identity, or diaspora that happened to be in dc. um, you had another question? {unknown speaker 2}: yeah-- speaker 1: yes speaker 2:     and as gentrification has occurred in chinatown more and more of the chinese businesses are getting bought up but it's like, it's like the burger joints and whatnot with chinese lettering. my question to you is do you, is there a fear that with time and with realestate properties going up that eventually small chinese businesses in chinatown will get bought up? you know it is looking very [[??]] and certainly it is a lot more secure than what you see before but how do we keep chinatown chinese? speaker 1: correct. and so one of the issues there, that very much is on top of everybody's mind. if you think about ***** chinatown and what makes it it's the individual entrepreneurs, the mom and pop shops, the little things like that that sell the ****** [[??]] and the all that kind of stuff *** *** that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up,   there is no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so   for like this. and at a certain point those people that operate those businesses like my mom and *** dad,     they     are getting old and  quit frankly they worked really hard to get you in college so you can get that law degree right? and    you are not going to go back there and run  the place so those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things that us that  are looking at property uh the development     of china how do we  encourage something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed, it's already gone by right? so, so i'm not sure what the real answer is to that, it could be city, maybe the city has to produce some kind of, of tax incentive that allows these things to stay. but, do you really want to do that, do you really want to encourage a small business that doesn't, that doesn't really make itself  productive or do you have an ordinance that say there should be ** asian related or chinese? those are all questions for us *********** [[??]]. my ** feeling just to finish off is that i think, i think  what we many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. i would like to see big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there it allows us to do those things that make our chinese life significant. the wedding, the, the **** [[??]], the *** ching-ming festival or something where you bring your family there. you have to create so, it's not so much that small definition of a shop but it is a chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities. speaker 2: yeah.   so, we'er almost at the end of our  time so we got closing comments here. {speaker name=woman} uh yeah i um i agree that it is difficult to have small    business it's just not profitable um also i think housing is also a problem.  thats why people ****** can't afford to live there. we have all these expensive condominiums {speaker=woman} unless you have, you  know, a high income. it seems impossible. so, but we do have people who do want to live there. they want to raise their families there. and there's no affordable housing. and low-income housing seems to be disappearing too. so, there's all sorts of problems and i really don't know ****** what can be done, really. speaker 1: yeah, my fear is that what we're going to end up having in ** dc‚Äîbecause of the gentrification and so ***** forth‚Äîis that what we're going to end up having is **** a commercial chinatown. where we have very few residents living there. and that would be a real ***** ******* *** shame, really. i think in las vegas, they have what they called a chinatown in a mall. to me, that is not a chinatown, really. and i think it's incumbent upon the city to provide affordable housing. right now, there's ***** *********    3 billion affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping block. because ******* it's such a hot area, they want to turn that into a condominium. so, i don't really know what the answer is ********* basically. i think at the very least what we **** ** need is an infusion of capital **** ******* *** with... we have the foot trafficking area. the *** *** area is ** really a hot area now. but we need some entrepreneurs with some chinese connections who's willing to invest in the area. right now we have ** **** **** businesses like panera, starbucks, they're all coming in. but the chinese entrepreneurs, i think, are unwilling to make the investment. speaker 2: okay. very good. ***** i think i agree with all **** *** *** **** **** that. one point that i did want to emphasize on yours that, you know, ** i certainly don't want it to be a commercial ********* ***** * ***** **** ** ** ***** chinatown. none of us want a disneyland atmosphere there ***** **** for tourists to come in ***** and gawk at the chinese people there. and that's not ****** *** a ********* *** chinatown. we want it to be meaningful. i think what they're saying is right. we're ***** going to have help from the city planners to bring in the right businesses and *** ** make the right conditions there to make it ****  work. [clears throat] excuse me.   so, coming to the end here. so, again, i want * **** to read again from **** this quote here  'cause i think it's very significant that what **** ***** bonnie tsui says in  his book **** ***** here, says: the myth of america lies in its patchwork heritage. though the united states hasn't always tolerated difference, it ********* continues‚Äîto this *** day‚Äîto be built by ********** *** immigrants. this contradiction ** in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening: the birth of cultural pride **** is still evolving. visitors of chinatown have a ***** role‚Äîwe all have a **** role‚Äîjust as residents do in   a bartering of  culture currency. if there's authenticity to be experienced, it's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. this is a reminder of what makes america ******* *** *** special. after a century and a half of chinese immigration, chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into america and for american-born chinese into their chinese heritage. and ** so, thank you all for your attention today. and i thank ted, walter, and *** shirley for their participation here. and really, i said you guys got * **** your assignments today. you helped us out. helped us with chinatowns. you know, make it **** ** work for ** *****   us. make it work for  you too. thank you. speaker 1: yeah uh, don't go too far away because starting in just a few more minutes we'll have another panel discussion, this one entitled young historians living histories. so starting in a just a few minutes as we get set up, young historians living histories. yeah   no, we're moving onto the next one. so i'd like to welcome you to day number five of the 2014 smithsonian folklife festival. today is diaspora day and that's diaspora day both for ***\n",
      "HYP: ******* ** hello, hello everyone. we're getting set up for our next session in      tea    house comments. ** you are in the china program of the 2014 smithsonian folklife  festival ******* ** this program is presented through a collaboration by the center for folklife and cultural heritage at the smithsonian with the china international  culture  association working with the china arts and entertainment group in beijing. ******* ** thanks a lot for being  here today i don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different  today ******* ** the china festival program actually brought over 120 artists and presenters from china to participate in this program, ******* ** but today we're *** doing something a little bit  different we're calling it  diaspora   day ******* ** there are about four million people of chinese ancestry in the united  states and today we're celebrating the way in which when people  move how they transform and adapt  culture  community and traditions to the new police places where they end  up ******* ** so today this this session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is a  part of the diaspora day  programming which is also co-produced with the smithsonian asian       pacific american  center ******* ** so we have ** today's session right now that you're we're getting ready to start is the 1882 foundation talk story on the  mall and we are going to be talking about china town     today  china      town today is the subject of this  session ******* ** and i'm going to go ahead and introduce to *** stan   lu who is going to do the presenting and the moderating of this session with our with our experts here  today our local  experts     and ** i want to first introduce you to stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882  foundation ********* ******* ** so stan   lu sitting right here to my  left is a retired civil  engineer he used to work for the federal aviation  administration and he went to china for the first time in  2003    2003 ** ***** he spent two years two years there's teaching chinese at a  university and when he came back to the us he became very interested and committed   to working with chinese american  organizations ******* ** stan is himself a native of greenville,  mississippi which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the  mic *** but stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of chinese   american as well as the 1882  foundation ******* ** and for those of you who don't  know the 1882 foundation is a   nonpartisan non-profit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of chinese exclusion  laws ******* ** and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep chinese immigrants out of the united states and to prevent those who were here already from ever obtaining  citizenship ******* ** so they've **** been doing really wonderful work around the country ** and i'm now going to turn it over to stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel.   okay. ** *** thank you     so     jin hey, **** ******* ** it's * pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and we       and this is diaspora  day like so   jin was saying  here and ***** ****** i'm gonna introduce everybody here     are we gonna? we're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are because i don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over credentials that it really don't matter, ******* ** you know, what we say is what's gonna be  important ******* ** so ********* ******* ** so this is diaspora day and you  know and you  know the epitome of diasporos in the united states of course are       china   towns ** and that's that's what we think about when when talking about  the display       the chinese who are away from china in the united  states they're china      towns  is the first  thing   to come to my  mind and so, you know when we put out our  flyer you know we said that you       know that we're gonna talk about china      town  today and *** but this is not gonna ** be a travel         log by any means,    you    know we  want    to talk about what china      town means to  us and *** because like we said in the flyer  china      town has different meanings to different  people ******* ** and one of the references i have ** this book called american    china      towns written by bonnie  suey and so i'll just read briefly what she says  about you  know     china town     usa  a ** state of  mind a world within a  world a  neighborhood that exists in more cities than you might  imagine every day americans ** ********* ******* ** ********** find something different in       china    town it's **** a place is  foreign yet  familiar by now quite well known on the          western cultural   radar ** but splitting the difference still gives many visitors to china      town the sense above  all that things are not    what ** ********* ******* ** ***** they  seem and popular culture        has been telling us this for  decades and it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on beneath the surface of the vibrant   microcosm       a ** ** place with its own deeply felt history and stories of          national       cultural significance, so *** you  know our panel today is going to talk  about you  know what this means to to the apa  community chinese         american community from our       from     our viewpoint and then we  don't we won't agree on everything because         you    know as  you as those of you who  are **** chinese americans or  chinese know that   you    know there's  very ******* ** we argue a lot, ******* ** so we have differences of opinion about what china      town means to us and we  have and certainly the three  panelists here **** we  all have our own opinions about  it and *** ******* ** but one thing  that you  know and * also what you  in the audience to be thinking about it to  you  what does china      town mean to   you ******* ** and you  know that's going    to be your takeaway **** for today is come out of this this session  here real *** thinking about what china      town means ******* ** when you go but   when if you're here in the dc  area go to dc china       town and see you  know what does it  mean to  you and you  know           and because it's changing every  day   china towns *********** and so our lowest ** you from out of  town go back to your hometowns and and look at the china      towns  there and what does   it mean to you?      so that's        that's your assignment from      coming from the  day  but so  our our group  here one thing we have in common. i think     is    is that  we we all are  all  abcs ******* ** that's american born chinese.     so, ** ** you know,  we *** have that perspective that       that we  aren't    we're born in this country. so we are americans, but we're awesome but we're  really definitely chinese  americans ******* ** we're all active in in the dc china       town and we do participate in our talk story events that we  have in china       town every  month ******* ** where we gather the community together    to share stories of our experiences as growing up as chinese  americans asian americans, ******* ** you know and what that  means ** and you  know we have this monthly in in china      town and so if you  want if you're interested          in if you're in the area, you  know talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are gonna be *** ******* ** but for today, it's china       town it's       it's talk story on the  mall and so i'm  gonna the way we're gonna introduce each ourselves         is    i'm gonna go down here and and ask the  question you  know    what does china town ********* mean to   you ******* ** ********* ******* ** and  how is it important to   you ******* ** and  then you ***** tell us who you are? you  know what ****** your relationship  is and  then and then *** tell us ******* ** ********* ******* ** you want to  start surely who  is    is  involved so tell us about who you  are and then  what and answer the  questions     you didn't        do     it. okay yeah, ***** my name is shirley will actually, i was born in  washington    dc and my involvement in china      town is because i'm the director of the china      town service  center which is part of the chinese community church ** the only chinese community church in washington    dc we like to  say and actually the reason i'm here is  because another  lady    was unable to make  it and she really was born and worked in china      town for many  years and she had one of the first stores in china      town that's doing in existence  today anyway, i'm here *** to be part of this  panel and they tell you that china      town is very meaningful to  me even though i was born in    dc and then my parents used to come to china      town when we were quite  young and at that time it was a lot different. it was a lot smaller        a lot  quieter and it was a way for people to meet people like themselves   to speak their  languages to have a cup of  tea to go over old news about what was happening in  china what was going on in  america and i think it's important to me because it is a  community even though we think of it as maybe just a place people come to eat or it's a touristy  place but there are real residents that live  there and it's important. i  think to maintain  that ****** *** ***** *** ******** my name is walter wu. i'm shirley's            husband and i also help at the chinatown service center, which is a part of the chinese community  church which is located in the heart of chinatown.       this    is that's where we  worship i am an    abc and american born chinese. i was born in  texas a transplant here in  1972 and in san antonio, we didn't have a  chinatown and i think for that reason i have a special  appreciation if not a greater appreciation of  chinatown even though the one in    dc it's quite  small as  compared let's  say to the ones in new york or san francisco or los  angeles we tutor immigrants with  their help them improve their  english on saturday   morning we have a  program and we also help them with their  citizenship and we know how valuable that the residents of fine living in chinatown  is you  know  we you may go to  chinatown and it may have shrunk in terms of the commercial  chinatown in terms of the number of  restaurants but i think you will  see    you find a significant number of chinese that live  there they they live  in mainly in three public housing projects located not that far from the heart of  chinatown so i think  the when we help not just ourselves, but we have  other  two ** have one of our  tutors  actually who's  here who's been a  longtime tutor at our saturday  program and i think the reward that we get is that when we help immigrants improve their english or help them in some  way we can see the smile on their  face we can see the  appreciation and we can see the gratitude that they  have and  chinatown what it  is  it's it provides an instant a community for the chinese to ** fellowship with other chinese and with similar  language so it's  really ** a very key part in helping assimilate into this  country ******* ** ** so my name     is ted  gong i'm i'm from california  and everybody's using these terms     abc ******* ** and i'm      abc and american-born  chinese but as you guys all know  probably there's  always  like      hip * hong kong instant  product   mit ** made in  taiwan all that kind of stuff like this,   but  abc      and when i  i'm ******** about a fourth or fifth       generation chinese from  california from  fresno anybody from  fresno anybody know fresno?     fresno ******* ***** ******* and we of course didn't have a chinatown  there and the chinatown that we always go to is either san  francisco  primarily or to los  angeles     and ** **** you  know the thing about growing up in the rural california  is i think there's probably like one or two other chinese families in my  town mostly we   pick i was just talking with somebody about picking cotton ********* you  know *** the long cotton bags and you    drag the cotton bags and    do things like  this but you would always ** my mom and dad ran a grocery store in in        a little tiny grocery store in rosie,  california near dainuba, california, which is there fresno, but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always say we've    got    to go to  daifu  daifu san francisco  chinatown you have to go back to buy the  groceries to get to talk to the to the family  folk to have the  banquets to have the  weddings and so    for so chinatown has that meaning as well. it is a place in which you rejuvenate in many  levels  one to get the groceries that you can't get in rural,  california to get the food    or the  banquet that familiar  taste to talk with those  relatives to have those banquets and those  meals and so  forth  chinatown  historically and this   dc         china has had that same  purpose has changed over       originally a place for immigrants to come       still is a place for immigrants to  come to get the  skills the  language get used to the  america  america so that they can go off and do better things      in  before chinatown has other  purposes during the exclusion acts ** we talk about the 1882 exclusion act chinatown's        are **** actually a protective  place you  know in  8200 ***** and so forth if you were chinese in * rural part of california during the time when the chinese exclusion acts was going  on the explosion  period you could be  killed you  know and chinatown was a protective  enclave that is the place where chinatown's gather together *** protect  themselves in  california just to let you  know after the exclusion  acts and the period which they call the expulsion  period there were officially 200  roundups of  chinese rural  chinese   kick out of the  areas or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge chinese from the  districts and      chinatown   function as a  place a protective  place later  on it becomes a place where immigrants get  skills later  on it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the  community like in   dc  here the original   dc chinatown  here does anybody know where the original   dc chinatown  was   is  a federal  triangle the original chinatown was   a federal  triangle and it's expect         it was then pushed off to where it is now and it's now constricted to where it  is so it continues to  evolve but there      is something about chinatown that is different. there is a sense that chinatown is a place where you can get  identity it's linked with chinese         american identity. it's linked with our  culture it's linked with a desire to go  back like  myself to find those things which make up our culture and our  identity chinatown can be a concept as well as a  place ******* ** very  good very  good so yeah, i think  all all three of  you what you said is *** you know, right  on it's ***** it's  different there's different views of what chinatown  is ******* ** and again i'm gonna ** quote from this book  here because i think it has some great quotes in  it  here  the truth is that chinatown is a space of  self-invention ******* ** the oldest chinese  immigrants  including but not limited  to those who landed in the port cities of new  york san  francisco los  angeles  honolulu ******* ** had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at  large ******* ** these  days new immigrants continue to come for a new  life and a search for   and a search for a cultural  identity brings chinese         americans of many generations back to walk alongside   them ******* ** and i  guess you  know i kind    of   fall in that latter category about looking for myself       identity because ** ******** you  know what chinatown means to me  is you know, i feel good  there for some reason, ******* ** you  know i can't explain it  because you  know my upbringing was was such that i grew up in  mississippi like so   jen  said during the  40s and   50s during extremely a bad time  there ******* ** where i **** ** was just not fun being chinese, you know, we were picked  on we were  abused and we couldn't go to schools with anybody  else    we **** had to build a one-room schoolhouse ******* ** for us where we had all of our      all the families in the city of greenville in one school       house  and  house all 12 grades with one  teacher ******* ** so, you know   for      that was kind of life. **** i was brought up  with and so i said, hey, it's no fun being  chinese ******* ** i'm not gonna ** be chinese. so  i ** you know, i literally rejected my  heritage ran away from it, you know,   try to forget who i  was     and and ******** so my long journey back       so i'm on    a journey of self-discovery  now because  i ****** **** think i've come  back you know, i'm proud to be chinese         american  now and it's part of and     chinatown's a part of   my    help ** ****** me in finding myself       identity and that and that's         i think that's a very key part of what why we're espousing what       the importance of chinatown's  here for  me because there's **** a personal  journey i think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community and so, you know,          i would like to  ask you know, walter and shirley,     you know you  know as you grew up, you know, maybe you're growing up wasn't as drastic as  mine        you ******* ** * ***** ********* know, i didn't handle it  well me **** *** probably  handle it the better than i  did  but you know, so how did that influence you know how you *** review chinatown's now and  and you know, what was it mean?     you're growing up,     even though you didn't grow up in a  chinatown   yeah, ** **** ******* ** ********* ***** **** *** ** ******* ** ***** *** **** i grew up in   dc ** actually, *** we had a laundry in southeast  near     i      guess over the  bridge pennsylvania  avenue and at that  time in the schools i went  to elumentary and even miller school. there weren't that many  asians so of course i    was stood out    there'll    be  like *** ***** maybe one other girl who might be  chinese and then she moved away not *** be only asian person  there and my friends were always to be amazed at the beginning of school year how teachers would always remember my name, but of course, you know, i was the only person who was  asian *** you  know had black  hair black  eyes or  whatever so i was     i'm ** aware that i'm chinese. i'm different from my caucasian friends, even  though they probably didn't look at me that way, which was  good but i always knew that i was different, you know, my food was different at  home i didn't eat sandwiches like they did. **** *** ***** we always had rice at  lunchtime you know, it was just different, you know, i had to stay  in  and  we  know we had a  laundry and you  know *** their parents living ** a  house and so my dream  was someday *** that i was gonna have a house  too and have and be like that dick and jane  book and have a dog and a  cat and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay  home     anyway *** ******* we do have a  house so i did   look be able to lift this american  dream but yeah, i'm always aware that i'm  chinese and chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to to meet their  friends again, you  know to  talk to meet people of their same languages        and that's that's always important for  everybody ******* ** ******** ***** well, my background was entirely different.       i ** i grew up in  texas   actors * *** born in san  antonio  were the major population hispanic ********* ******* ** so there really weren't that many chinese there and     so      it you know, we    did      what chinese food we ate was was from my mother's cooking at  home basically, *********** you know, so we didn't have a  chinatown ******* ** or anything like  that   we visit relatives for chinese ******** and so  forth and that was about the extent of the chinese  population ******* ** so when i came to washington,   dc to work in  1972   end up staying because i met my wife here, ******* ** but i remember when i visited new york city for the first time during chinese new  year ******* ** i was just so mesmerized by the number of chinese in new york chinatown, ******* ** i  mean to  me it was so impressive to see so many chinese  there       i was thrilled to  death  really       i ** i never experienced something like that. so         it's  great  really    it it's a it's a great thrill, you  know to be among other chinese and to see         go into a chinatown ******* ** where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so  forth and they're all were so  thriving  really so it really was an eye-opening experience for  me and it's something that i always will appreciate and even though the   dc chinatown is relatively small, ******* ** but i think we both love  it in terms of trying to we identify  sure,           my wife shirley and  i you know, we're first       generation. we're born  here so we identify very much with what the immigrants are going  through and so our church has a chinatown service center that caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth. so we both are  very very involved with  that we have a program that where we tutor immigrants with their english and help them with their citizenship. so for both of  us  has been  very very  rewarding ******* ** so i  mean so what what is the aura about chinatown  and makes chinatown a chinatown, you know    as  as so, you know, what is it? we're talking a lot of intangibles here.     it seems like   but a lot of real stuff  too but but there are lots of intangibles. would you say  that  read that ***** ted?   yeah, so **** *** so i hope that there  is actually i hope that other people can contribute some ideas *********** as  well the idea of a chinatown is where the   what i remember one person one time somebody asked  me he says that he  says  why should we     should we ** should we not preserve chinatown? this is actually a boston urban  planner * chinatown urban planner      and he says, you know, that's a bit that's a philosophical question if you ask me how do you preserve chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and the constructions and the  sites and so  forth well, that's a question i can answer as an engineer or a  designer but if you ask me should we or should we not preserve chinatown? then that's a question of a lot philosophical question and i'm not sure all of us have the right answer to  that another person said to  me that  says chinatown is where the chinese people  are if that's the  case then if you use the   dc example, **** there are not that many chinese residents  physically people living in chinatown anymore many more are moving toward rockville. everybody knows  that if you're *** talking about where the food  is there are good chinese restaurants in chinatown there are others and even more than other places          in maryland  in different places of this sort  they in new york you talk about not just one chinatown  a mott  street you talk about three or four chinatowns because the different congregations of people and their restaurants have  moved in  philadelphia the restaurants have moved and so forth and and so  on so what is it that makes  chinatown chinatown and where things  are think about it  again right now. there are more chinese festivals being done in the urban area.    so you have these big festivals being done say at tyson's corner or oak ** at one of the malls    and they have these great dances all day long for chinese new year or   for qingming and you  will go there and everybody  will celebrate those things and learn a little bit *** eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about chinese  culture but you would never say that tyson's corner or fair oaks mall is chinatown      which you would never say that right    but and you would have a hard time saying just because there's a concentration of people in  rockville that rockville is chinatown. there's something about that term chinatown in these historical chinatowns that make makes   it what it is and i'm not sure what it is. it's *** ******* ** ***** ***** a      yes yes yes ****** ********** *** ******* ** yes,   so *** but at the same time    so he is  saying that how do you how how do you keep a chinatown in the country ** * ******* **** ** as diverse as the united states is? that raises another interesting  question everybody  else other ethnic groups have their own  barrios their own fishermen's   war for something ** this  sort should all those places be preserved separately as we  grow ** we ***** ** remember that i was raised and  say a part of new york  city but i don't necessarily want to maintain that  area if i were raised in the projects in  detroit that's defined my character and  stuff but i don't        want this or preserve  that that that that  building  right but why is it then that do we want to preserve    a chinatown  area do we have any answers to that?   yeah, ** **** who has answers to that? you know my own my own answer somewhat        is i agree. i mean it     is it's hard when to  answer  but you  know i'm saying that you know what i what i read what i read  earlier is that that chinatown you know has his own deeply filled history and stories of  national cultural significance and i think one of the things about chinatown is it was a protective area for us as opposed to you     know this is where we had to be and i think you know there's lots of stories there that need to be preserved you       know if  not the structures of  themselves then the stories that go behind know why these china why were chinatowns there? i think that's ** important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about you   know why were these why did that the the chinese population? retreat into these  chinatowns and and and they got the reputation             it's not because that you know they wanted to per   se but but then they were they were kind of forced into that area and they persevered there and i think that's how they became a stronger community it made for a sense of community and i think that that kind of history is  there i don't know. i don't know if you disagree or not agree with me walter or        so     you so part of the community is part of it is the  community the current community  there the   historic  community but part of it is sort of the hollywood myth of chinatown        who you  know you have chinatown movies you  have  everybody you talk about the for better or  worse whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like  this chinatown evokes an image that i think  other other i think communities don't necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for the chinese americans.  yeah immersion ** ****** and culture ******** *********** i think that's what       why **** **** *** **** ***** ***** is ****** **** *** **** that ***** ** ***** **** *** ***** ** * ***** ***** ************ ******* ****** *** *** *** ***** ******* ****** *** so * ***** ****** **** ********* **** *** ***** ***** **** ** * ******* ****** ****** *** ***** **** **** **** ***** ** ******* ** **** ******** ******* ** ******* ** ********* ** ***** *** one of the things she's saying is  that growing up oklahoma ********* you come back much like stan is  saying or walter is  saying you come in and suddenly you surround it  by *** things that your  parents or  grandparents  or that kind    of stuff that happens ******** and that gives you another sense of *** * part of your identity  in  history but why is that  that you get that from a  chinatown and not from say **** going to the chinese historical museum in new  york or the  inju island  museum   and why is it that it's a  chinatown      that does  that that  place? ******** ************* ** ******* ** ***** ***** i think it's just an aura  there       that does  that because     i agree that what you're saying there because      you   know, i don't speak chinese      you    know  so     you know people say they go to chinese because they *** hear people speaking they're saying      like i don't understand a word that's being said  there   by chinese people there  since     so you    know and  i  can say ***** i ran away from my chinese  heritage   so i   really don't  identify but  somehow when i'm there, you     know, i feel like   hey staying your home  and something  is   it  you   know, i use the  term   is a cultural touchstone for  me *** in my personal journey and i think it i think that resonates with lots *** of people like me who who've had us who've kind of run away from their identity or *** not sure what their identity is because the duality that  we chinese americans face in this country, you know, you know living especially second generation people like  us  they're        a generation *********** ***** *********** fourth generation.   yeah. ** yeah, **** i think for those who chinese americans who are born here you know, we may tend to view chinatown more ** in the abstract as something that has enduring meaning      and i think it does because it's it's a part of our history and so forth but i but i think there's ** another level which is much more basic and * ***** that is for the immigrants  who come you know, they seek comfort in like kind  language  in other people who've **** had experiences just like them and so it to me, it's it's it's very very basic  really it's security for immigrants    who come and i think when you find someone who is sharing somewhat the same experience that you're *** about to embark on it provides a tremendous amount of comfort and security so in even in   dc chinatown when we look at it, we may find that it seemed to be relatively small but really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants i think it means so much to them and i think we see that in our interaction at the chinatown service  center the immigrants  who come in for help sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for  translation   to get something in the mail *** they don't know what this is so you  can i think what we always try to do is put put ourselves in an immigrants  place imagine if you were to go to china and know not a word of chinese and then how would you  cope and so? i think that is the attitude that we take when we assist immigrants who come to the chinatown service center seeking  help ***** ** sounds like that's that's   a real toughy kirk  you know    she's    asking   you    know     how do  how ******* ********** ********* do *** **** *** ******** ** *** we *** ******** ********* *** ***** *** **** *** ********* *** ******* **** *** ********* **** ****** ******* ****** *** ******** ********** ******** ********** ********* **** ********* ******* ** ****** * **** ******* **** ** you know  i announced **** *** ** ** *** the question? i really want to present here as sort of our  assignment you  know how how do we do this? how how do we maintain because ***** you're not gonna    you're  not you   know dc chinatown? it's not gonna ** have a lot of residents  again you know   and like like san francisco where you're selling fish you know on the open market there and things like that and and a lot of people living there and speaking the language in chinese and in dialects and so  forth so that's a hard one to  answer you  know how do we preserve this this feeling here and preserve  this most of  all the history that's been there and and the and the people who  live  there   play  their    life and   cry there * the whole  thing       so  so so part part of it  is you do have to maintain the physical appearance of the  time that boundaries   to define  it whether it's the  architecture the   little whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another   question but there's something that allows it to be  distinct so in dc chinatown for  example shops have to have chinese characters on their  windows  right and  so those kind of things seem  superficial but they are still important enough to help define that  space then what you do in that space is  important what are the activities that you do  there do you allow the family? associations to continue to operate  there does the city given enough           a family  association **** talking very much about the    lee  association the more you're associated           on    long and things of these  sorts these things don't have the original purpose that they have in the sense  that everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke  chinese chinese nights  be english ******** and they did a lot of  extra or  judiciary or sort of semi      judiciary  type of  functions but they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they  do chinese  consolidate benevolent association still represents 30        some odd associations of chinese people and organizations * they do annually the chinese new year  parade those type of things are important still to  do and we should have the  city and continue to encourage  that the  building space does      it have places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which    tan is talking  about so if the people have or      have gone  there and lived  there and have a story to tell and we ought to have a way to his preserve  it and then to     once we preserve   it to tell it so that the next generation or other  people not just the next generation  chinese but other people  who are passing through a giant      town know that there are stories created in china      town that represented the chinese  identity or diaspora that happened to be in  dc *** you had another  question ******** ******* *** ****** ******* ** yes       i  i correct ** ************** *** ******** ** ********* **** and **** ** *** ******* ********** *** ******* ****** ** *** **** ***** **** **** *** ****** ****** *** ******* **** ******* ********** ** ******** ** *** ** ** **** ** ***** * **** **** **** **** *** **** ********** ********** ***** ** **** ********** ***** ******* ********** ** ********* **** *** ****** *** *** **** ** ** ******* **** ****** *** ********* ** ** * *** **** ****** **** **** *** *** ****** *** *** ** ** **** ********* ******** ******* ** ******** *** so one of the issues  there that very much is on top of everybody's  mind if you think about china      town and what makes it it's the individual  entrepreneurs the mom and pop  shops the little things like that   to sell the chashu    bow and the all that kind of stuff did you that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up? there's ** no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so forth like  this and at a certain point those people that operate those businesses **** my mom and dad   or somebody they're getting old and quite frankly they worked really hard to get you in college so you *** get that law degree  right and you're *** not gonna ** go back there and run that place so those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things   as us  who have looking at property as the development china, ***** how do we encourage? something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed. it's already gone by  right  so so i'm not sure what the real answer is to  that it could be city. maybe the city has to produce some kind *** of tax incentive that allows these things to  stay  but do you really want to do that? do you really want to encourage a small business that  doesn't that doesn't really make itself productive? or do you have ** ordinance **** say there should be an asian related ** chinese? those are all questions for us practically   today my my feeling just to finish off is that i  think i think what? we many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. i would like to see big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there it allows us to do those things that make our chinese life  significant the  wedding  the the moon     you the the   qingming festival or something where you bring your family  there you have to create  so it's not so much that small definition of a shop but it is a chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your  activities   yeah, so well, yeah, we're almost at the end of our time. so we get closing comments  here ******** *********** ** **** * ** * ***** **** it is difficult to have small businesses. it's just not profitable it also i think housing is also a problem. that's why people cannot paint afford to live  there we have all these expensive condominiums *************** unless you  have   a little a high  income it seems impossible.  so but we do have people who do want to live  there they want to raise their families  there and there's no affordable  housing and low-income housing  seem to be disappearing  too  so there's all sorts of problems and i really don't know really what can be  done  really ******* ** yeah, my fear is that what we're gonna ** end up having in dc    because of the gentrification and so forth       is that what    we ***** ** end up having is just a commercial  chinatown where we have very few residents living  there and that would be a real shame really, you  know,      we i think in las  vegas they have what they   call a chinatown in a  mall to  me that is not a  chinatown  really and i think it's incumbent upon the city to provide affordable  housing right now. there's three buildings that     are affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping  block because because it's such a hot area. they want to turn that into a  condominium  so i don't ****** know what the answer is basically        but i think at the very least what we know we need is an infusion of capital with because you   know, we have  to  put     traffic    in the air the area is is really a hot area  now but we need some entrepreneurs with some chinese connections who's willing to invest in the  area right now we have we have this         is like  panera starbucks. they're all coming  in but the chinese  entrepreneurs i  think are unwilling to make the  investment   okay, ** ***** very good. yeah, i think i agree with all that and you know that   the one point that i did want to emphasize on yours  that you know, we i certainly don't want it to be a commercial chinatown yeah, i don't want to we don't       know none of us want a disneyland atmosphere there we're just for tourists to come in there and gawk at the chinese people  there and that's not that's not a chinatown you      know, we want it to be meaningful. i think what they're saying is right. we're gonna  have to help help from the city planners to bring in the right businesses and and to make the right conditions there to make it work excuse     me,     but     so  so we're coming to the end  here  so again, i want i want to read again from from this quote here because i think it's very significant that what what what? bonnie suey says in this book here says,   you know, the myth of america lies in its patchwork  heritage though the united states hasn't always tolerated  difference it continues           to this day     to be built by immigrants the         cut this contradiction is in founding myths led to an ethnic  awakening the birth of cultural pride that is still  evolving visitors in chinatown have a role.     you all have a role      just as residents do in the bartering of cultural  currency if there's authenticity to be  experienced it's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. it's ** a reminder of what makes america special and and       so after a century and a half of chinese  immigration chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into america and for american-born chinese into their chinese  heritage and so   i thank you all for your attention  today and i think  ted  walter and and shirley for their participation  here and  really i said you guys got a year   of     silence   then you   help us  out   help us with  chinatowns you  know make it make it work for us here. we're make it work for you, too. thank  you ******* ** **** *** don't go too far away because starting in just a few **** minutes we'll have another panel  discussion this one entitled young historians living  histories so starting in * just a few minutes as we get set  up young historians living  histories yeah yeah,    no ****** **** *** **** **** so i'd like to welcome you to day number five of the 2014 smithsonian folklife  festival today is diaspora day and that's diaspora day both for the\n",

going to be talking about ***** chinatown today ***** chinatown today is the subject of this session speaker 1 and im going to go ahead and introduce to you stan liu who is going to do the presenting and *** moderating of this session with our **** *** experts here today our local experts speaker 1 i want to first introduce you to stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 foundation silence speaker 1 so stan liu sitting right here to my left is a retired civil engineer he used to work for the federal aviation administration and he went to china for the first time in 2003 speaker 1 2003 he spent two years *** *****  there teaching chinese at a university and when he came back to the us he became very interested and committed with working with chinese american organizations speaker 1 stan is himself a native of greenville mississippi which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic um but stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of chinese americans as well as the 1882 foundation speaker 1 and for those of you who dont know the 1882 foundation is a nonpartisan nonprofit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of chinese exclusion laws speaker 1 and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep chinese immigrants out of the united states and ** prevent those who were here already from ever attaining citizenship speaker 1 so   they have been doing really wonderful work around the country um and im now going to turn it over to stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel speaker 2 ok thank you sojin speaker 2 hey speaker 2 its a pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and uh wereand this is diaspora day like ** sojin was saying here and were gonna im gonna introduce everybody here speaker  2   and were gonna have a conversation and youll get to know who we are   cause i dont want to spend a whole lot of time going over credentials that ** really dont matter speaker 2 you know what we say is whats gonna be important speaker 2 so silence speaker 2 so this is diaspora day and you know and you know the epitome of diasporas in the united states of course are chinatowns speaker 2 and thats ***** what we think about when when *******    we talk   about displaced chinese *** *** away from china in the united states speaker     2 chinatowns are the first things that come to my mind and so *** **** when we put out our flyer you know we said **** *** thatthat  uhh were gonna talk about ***** chinatown today and uh but this is not gonna to be a ****** travelogue by any means *** speaker  2 were gonna talk about what ***** chinatown means to us and uh because like we said in the flyer ***** chinatown has different meanings to different people speaker 2 and one of the references i have is this book called ******** ùòàùòÆùò¶ùò≥ùò™ùò§ùò¢ùòØ ùòäùò©ùò™ùòØùò¢ùòµùò∞ùò∏ùòØùò¥ written by bonnie tsui and so ill just read briefly what she says about you know ***** chinatown usa speaker 2 a state of mind a world within a world a neighbourhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine every day speaker 2 silence speaker 2 americans find something different in chinatown speaker 2 its a place as foreign yet familiar by now quite well known on the ******* westerncultural radar speaker 2 but splitting the difference still gives many visitors to ***** chinatown the sense above all that things are not speaker 2 silence speaker 2 what they seem and     uhh popular culturals been telling us this for decades and its true that few visitors realize just how much goes on beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm speaker 2 a place with its own deeply felt history and stories of ******** nationalcultural significance speaker 2 so you know our panel today is going to talk about you know what this means to ** the apa community     uhh chineseamerican community from our viewpoint speaker         2 and then we dont we wont agree on everything ******* *** cause as you as those of you who are uhh chinese americans or chinese know that *** yknow theres very speaker 2 we argue a lot speaker 2 so we have differences of opinion about what ***** chinatown means to us and we have and certainly the three panellists here all we all have our own opinions about it and uh speaker 2 but one thing that you know and i also want you and the audience to be thinking about it ** too what does ***** chinatown mean to you speaker 2 and you know thats ***** gonna be your     take away for today is come out of this **** session here real uh thinking about what ***** chinatown means speaker 2 when you go *** about if youre here in the dc area go to dc ***** chinatown and say you know what does it mean to you and you know whatandand   cause its changing every day speaker     2 chinatowns and so are  those of you from out of town go back to your hometowns and *** look at *** these chinatowns there and what   do they mean to you speaker     2 thatsthats your assignment **** fromcoming from the day but so our our group here one thing we have in common i think ** isis that we we all are all abcs speaker 2 thats american born chinese speaker 2 so you know we uh have that perspective **** thatthat we arent wewere born in this country so we are americans but were    also but were really definitely chinese americans speaker 2 were all active in ** the dc ***** chinatown and we do participate in our talk story events that we have in ***** chinatown every month speaker 2 where we gather the community together toto share stories of our experiences as growing up as chinese americans asian americans speaker 2 you know and what that means in and you know we have this monthly in ** ***** chinatown and so if you want if youre interested ** if youre in the area you know talk to us afterwards and well get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are going to be speaker 2 but for today its ***** chinatown  ii itsits talk story on the mall and so im gonna the way were gonna introduce each ourselves ** isim gonna go down here and *** ask the question you know speaker 2 what does ***** chinatown mean to you speaker 2 silence speaker 2 and how is it important to you speaker 2 and then you know tell us who you are you know  and whats your relationship is and then and then uh tell us speaker 2 silence speaker 2 you want to start shirly  wu uh isis involved so tell us about who you are and **** what and answer the questions speaker     2 silence shirley   wu ah yeah my name is shirley   wu actually i was born in washington dc and my involvement in ***** chinatown is because im the director of the ***** chinatown service center which is part of the chinese community church the only chinese community church in washington dc we like to say and actually the reason im here is because another lady wasnt   able to make it and she really was born and worked in ***** chinatown for many years and she had one of the first stores in ***** chinatown thats still in existence today anyway im here to to be part of this panel and   to tell you that ***** chinatown is very meaningful to me even though i was born in dc and then my parents used to come to ***** chinatown when we were quite young and at that time it was a lot different it was a lot smaller * lot quieter and it was a way for people to meet people like themselves that speak their languages to have a cup of tea to go over all news about what was happening in china what was going on in america and i think its important to me because it is a community even though we think of it as maybe just a place people come to eat or  as a touristy place but there are real residents that live there and its important i think to maintain that walter wu thank you shirley my name is walter wu im shirleys husbandlaughs and i also help at the chinatown service center which is a part of the chinese community church which is located in the heart of chinatown **** its thats where we worship i am an abc  an american born chinese i was born in texas a transplant here in 1972 and in san antonio we didnt have a chinatown and i think for that reason i have a special appreciation if not a greater appreciation of chinatown even though the one in dc its quite small as compared lets say to the ones in new york or san francisco or los angeles we tutor immigrants with their help them improve their english on saturday mornings we have a program and we also help them with their citizenship and we know how valuable that the residents ** find living in chinatown is you know we you may go to chinatown  it it may have shrunk in terms of the commercial chinatown in terms of the number of restaurants but i think you will see youll find a significant number of chinese that live there they **** live in mainly in three public housing projects located not that far from the heart of chinatown so i think the when we help not just ourselves but we have others too we have one of our tutors actually whos here whos been a longtime tutor at our saturday program and i think the reward that we get is that when we help immigrants improve their english or help them in some way we can see the smile on their face we can see the appreciation and we can see the gratitude that they have and chinatown what it is its it provides an instant * community for the chinese to do fellowship with other chinese and with similar language so its really a a very key part in helping assimilate into this country speaker 1 um so my **** names ted gong im ** from california and everybodys using these terms abc speaker 1 and im abc and americanborn chinese but as you guys all know probably theres always like hip hong kong instant product mit made in taiwan all that kind of stuff like this but abc *** when i si wasim about a fourth or ***** fifthgeneration chinese from california from fresno anybody from fresno anybody know fresno laughs anyway rural fresno and we of course didnt have a chinatown there and the chinatown that we always go to is either san francisco primarily or to los angeles speaker 1 and you know the thing about growing up in *** rural california is i think theres probably like one or two other chinese families in my town mostly we pick i was just talking with  someone about picking gr cotton you know and the long cotton bags and you dragged the cotton bags and doing things like this but you would always my mom and dad ran a grocery ***** ** ** storea little tiny grocery store in orosi california near  dinuba california which is  near fresno but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always say weve *** gotta go to taifu taifu san francisco chinatown you have to go back to buy the groceries to get to talk to the ** *** family folk to have the banquets to have the weddings and so forth so chinatown has that meaning as well it is a place in which you rejuvenate in many levels one to get the groceries that you cant get in rural california to get the food ** the banquet that familiar taste to talk with those relatives to have those banquets and those meals and so forth chinatown historically and this dc chinatown has had that same purpose has changed **** overoriginally a place for immigrants to **** comestill is a place for immigrants to come to get the skills the language get used to the america america so that they can go off and do better things ** before chinatown has other purposes during the exclusion  act we talk about the 1882 exclusion act chinatowns were actually a protective place you know in 1882 1800s and so forth if you were chinese in a rural part of california during the time when the chinese exclusion acts was going on the expulsion period you could be killed you know and chinatown was a protective enclave that is the place where chinatowns gather together and protect themselves in california just to let you know after the exclusion acts and the period which they call the expulsion period there were officially 200 roundups of chinese rural chinese kicked out of the areas or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge chinese from the districts  so chinatowns functioned as a place a protective place later on it becomes a place where immigrants get skills later on it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the community like in dc here the original dc chinatown here does anybody know where the original dc chinatown was its at federal triangle the original chinatown was the federal triangle and its ****** expandit was then pushed off to where it is now and its now constricted to where it is so it continues to evolve but ***** theres something about chinatown that is different there is a sense that chinatown is a place where you can get identity its linked with ******* chineseamerican identity its linked with our culture its linked with a desire to go back like myself to find those things which make up our culture and our identity chinatown can be a concept as well as a place speaker 2 very good very good so yeah i think that all three of you what you said is is you know right on you know its different theres different views of what chinatown is speaker 2 and again im going to quote from this book here because i think it has some great quotes in it here the truth is that chinatown is a space of selfinvention speaker 2 the oldest chinese immigrants including but not limited to those who landed in the port cities of new york san francisco los angeles honolulu speaker 2 had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large speaker 2 these days new immigrants continue to come for a new life and a search for and a search for a cultural identity brings ******* chineseamericans of many generations back to walk alongside them speaker 2 and i guess you know i **** kinda follow in that latter category about looking for     my selfidentity speaker 2 because you know what chinatown means to me is you know i feel good there for some reason speaker 2 you know i cant explain it because you know my upbringing was *** such that i grew up in mississippi like ** sojin said during the 40s and 50s during extremely a bad time there speaker 2 where i it it was just not fun being chinese you know we were picked on we were abused and we couldnt go to schools with anybody else where they had to build a oneroom schoolhouse speaker 2 for us where we had all of *** ourall the families in the city of greenville in one ****** schoolhouse that housed all 12 grades with one teacher speaker 2 so you know *** forthat was kind of the life i was brought up with and so i said hey its no fun being chinese speaker 2 im not going to be chinese so i i you know i literally rejected my heritage ran away from it you know tried to forget who i was speaker   2 andand so my long journey **** backso im on this journey of selfdiscovery now speaker 2 cause ii think ive come back you know im proud to be ******* chineseamerican now and its part ** *** ofchinatowns a part of my speaker 2 helped me in finding     my selfidentity and **** *** ***** thatsi think thats a very key part of **** why were espousing **** whatthe importance of chinatowns here for me speaker      2 its a personal journey i think its a personal journey for all of us here in the community *** ** *** **** andsoi would like to ask you know walter and shirley speaker    2 you know as you grew up you know maybe  your growing up wasnt as drastic as mine laughs speaker 2 i dont knowyou know i didnt handle it well  i mean you probably handled it *** better than i did but you know so how did that influence *** **** how you you review chinatowns now and *** you know  why  is it **** meanyour growing ** upeven though you didnt grow up in a chinatown speaker 1 ah speaker 1 shirley woo its not as drastic as that ah yeah i grew up in dc um actually ah we had a laundry in ********* south east nearjust over the bridge pennsylvania avenue and at that time in the schools i went to elementary and even middle school there werent that many asians so of course i always stood out  laughs there would be like maybe one other girl who might be chinese and then she moved away and id be only asian person there and my friends were always ** be amazed at the beginning of school year how teachers would always remember my name but of course you know i was the only person who was asian who you know had black hair black eyes or whatever so i was always am aware that im chinese im different from my caucasian friends even though they probably didnt look at me that way which was good but i always knew that i was different you know my food was different at home i didnt eat sandwiches like they did and you know we always had rice at lunchtime you know it was just different you know i had to stay in and you know we had a laundry and you know and their parents   live in a house and so my dream was    some day that i was gonna have a house too and **** *** be like that dick and jane book and have a dog and a cat and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay home laughs but anyway we do have a house so i did live be able to live this american dream but yeah im always aware that im chinese and chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to ** meet their friends again you know to talk to meet people of their same languages *** thats ***** always important for everybody speaker 2 walter woo well my background was entirely different speaker 2 i grew up in texas actually i was born in san antonio where the major population is hispanic speaker 2 so there really werent that many chinese there *** ** speaker   2  and so itwe didwhat chinese food we ate was *** from my mothers cooking at home basically laughs you know so we didnt have a chinatown speaker 2 or anything like that wed visit relatives who were chinese and so forth and that was about the extent of the chinese population speaker 2 so when i came to washington dc to work in 1972 ended up staying because i met my wife here speaker 2 but i remember when i visited new york city for the first time during chinese new year speaker 2 i was just so mesmerized by the number of chinese in new york chinatown speaker 2 i mean to me it was so impressive to see so many chinese there iii was thrilled to death really speaker 2 i never experienced something like that so ititits great really ** its * its a great thrill you know to be among other chinese and to *** seegoing   to a chinatown speaker 2 where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth and   they all were so thriving really so it really was an eyeopening experience for me and its something that i always will appreciate and even though the dc chinatown is relatively small speaker 2 but i think we both love it in terms of trying ** ** ******** towe identifymy wife shirley and i you know were ***** firstgeneration were born here so we identify very much with what the  immigrant are going through and so our church has a chinatown service center that caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth so we both are very very involved with that we have a program that where we tutor immigrants with their english and help them with their citizenship so for both of us its been very very rewarding speaker 3 so i mean so what **** is the aura about chinatown that makes chinatown a chinatown you know as ** so you know what is it were talking a lot of intangibles here ** seems like you know a lot of real stuff too but *** *****   a  lot of intangibles would you say that agree with that ted speaker 4 yea so so i hope that there is actually i hope **** other people can contribute   to    my experiences as well the idea of a chinatown is *****  is where i remember one ****** *** time somebody asked me he says **** ** **** why should ** weshould we or should we not preserve chinatown this is actually a boston urban planner a chinatown urban planner *** he says  ya know thats a *** ***** * philosophical question if you ask me how do  we preserve chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and the constructions and the sights and so forth well thats a question i can answer as an engineer or a designer but if you ask me should we or should we not preserve chinatown then thats a ******** ** * *** philosophical question and im not sure all of us have the right answer to that another person said to me    i says chinatown is where the chinese people are if thats the case then if you use the dc example then there are not that many chinese residents physically people living in chinatown ******* many more are moving toward rockville everybody knows that if   you are talking about where the food is there are good chinese restaurants in chinatown there are others and even more   in other ****** placesin maryland and different places of this sort **** in new york you talk about not just one chinatown on mott street you talk about three or four chinatowns because the different congregations of people and   the restaurants have moved in philadelphia the restaurants have moved and so forth and *** so on so what is it that makes chinatown chinatown and where things are think about it again right now there are more chinese festivals being done in *** urban areas where you have these big festivals being done say at tysons corner or oak or at one of the malls *** they have these great dances all day long for chinese new year or ching     ming and you would go there and everybody would celebrate those things and learn a little bit and eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about chinese culture but you would never say that tysons corner or fair oaks mall is chinatown ***** you would never say that right *** and you would have a hard time saying just because theres a concentration of people in rockville that rockville is chinatown theres something about that term chinatown in these historical chinatowns that **** makes this what it is and im not sure what it is the speaker is being asked a question but i cannot understand it speaker 1 yes yes so but at the same time ** he is saying that how do you *** *** ** *** keep a chinatown in the country in a country that is as diverse as the unites states is that raises another interesting question everybody else other  ethic groups have their own barrios their own fishermans wharf  or something of this sort should all those places be preserved separately as we grow as we grow we remember that i was raised  in say a part of new york city but i dont necessarily want to maintain that area if i were raised in the projects in detroit thats defined my character and stuff but i dont necessarily want to preserve that that **** **** building right but why is it then that ** we want to preserve that chinatown area do we have any answers to that speaker 2 yea who has answers to that *** **** my own ** *** answers somewhat ** i agree * **** ** ** its hard when to answer but  ya know im saying that *** **** what i **** * read **** * **** earlier is that **** chinatown *** **** has its own deeply   felt history and stories of national cultural significance and i think one ** ***  thing about chinatown is it was a protective area for us as opposed ** *** **** this is where we had to be and i think *** **** theres lots of stories there that need to be preserved *** **** if not the structures ** themselves then the stories that go behind **** why ***** ***** *** were chinatowns there i think thats an important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about *** **** why **** ***** *** did **** the *** chinese population retreat into these chinatowns and *** *** they got the ********** reputationits not because **** *** **** they wanted to per say but *** **** they were **** **** kind of forced into that area and they persevered there and i think thats how they became a stronger community it made for a sense of community and i think that **** kind of history is there i dont know * **** **** if you disagree or not agree with me walter ** ** speaker  1 part of the community ** part of it is the community the current community there the historical community but part of it is sort of the hollywood myth of chinatown *** you know you have chinatown movies you have everybody you talk about the for better or worse whether its the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this chinatown evokes an image that i think other other * ethic communities **** necessarily evoke and its both positive and negative for *** chinese americans yeah   speaker 1 and culture speaker namewoman i grew up in oklahoma just like you guys where there is nobody else and just that sense of going back and going to a place where historically chinese and you see where perhaps and so i think thats  its something that you might could find in a history museum you dont have that same sense of feeling or real culture speaker 1 speaker 1 whwhwhy is that so one of the things shes saying is that growing up in oklahoma you come back much like stan is saying or walter is saying you come in and suddenly you surround it by uh things that your parents or grandparents all that **** kinda stuff that kinda happens and that gives you another sense of uh a part of your identity and history but why is   it that you get that from a chinatown and not from say going to the chinese historical museum in new york or the angel island museum  in why is it that its a chinatown thatthat does that that place speaker namespeaker 2 speaker 2 yyou know i think its just an aura there thththat does that   cause iii agree that what youre saying there because *** yknow i dont speak chinese *** yknow so yknow   so people say they go to   china      so they can hear people  speakin  their   same language i dont understand a word thats being said there bby chinese people there since so *** yknow and i like   i said i ran away from my chinese heritage sso i really dont identify but somehow when im there *** yyknow i feel like hey    stay in your home *** ********* uh and and yknow i use the term its a cultural touchstone for me uh in my personal journey and i think ** * ***** that resonates with    a lot of people like me *** whove had ** whove kind of run away from their identity or are not sure what their identity is because the duality that we chinese americans face in this country you know *** **** living especially second generation people like us speaker nameman in background third generation fourth generation speaker 1 yeah yeah i think for those who chinese americans who are born here you know we may tend to view chinatown more as in the abstract as something that has enduring meaning *** i think it does because  it  is a part of our history and so forth but i *** * think  there is another level  that is much more basic and i think that is for the immigrants that come *** **** they seek comfort in like kind languages and other people   who have had experiences just like them and so it to me its its *** very very basic really its security for immigrants whove come and i think when you find someone who is sharing somewhat the same experience that   you are about to embark on it provides a tremendous amount of comfort and security so ** even in dc chinatown when we look at it we may find that it  seems to be relatively small but really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants i think it means so much to them and i think we see that in our interaction at the chinatown service center the immigrants that come in for help sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation they get something in the mail and they dont know what this is so you can i think what we always try to do is put *** ourselves in an immigrants place imagine if you were to go to china and know not a word of chinese and then how would you cope and so i think that is the attitude that we take when we assist immigrants who come to the chinatown service center seeking help kirk it sounds like  what   you all  are saying   is that  the physical chinatown keeps getting smaller in many places washington included do you have any thoughts on how we can preserve chinatown and maybe not just the physical but perhaps also the histories that youre talking about the cultural histories unknown background speaker good question speaker 1 thats a real toughie kirk uh you know as       you ask how do we ask the question i really want to present here as sort of our assignment you know how *** do we do this how *** do we maintain   cause youre not going towere not you know dc chinatown  is not going to have a lot of residents again you know *** like **** san francisco where youre selling fish *** **** on the open market there and things like that and *** a lot of people living there and speaking the language in chinese and ** dialects and so forth so thats a hard one to answer you know how do we preserve this **** feeling here and preserve this most of all the history thats been there and  of the *** *** people who lived there played there laughed and cried there the whole thing speaker  2 so part **** of it is you ** have to maintain the physical appearance of the town  the boundaries that define it whether its the architecture the little whether or not theyre bona fide architecture is another question but theres something that allows it to be distinct so in dc chinatown for example shops have to have chinese characters on their windows right and so those kind of things seem superficial but they are still important enough to help define that space  and what you do in that space is important what are the activities that you do there do you allow the family associations to continue to operate there does the city  give     it enoughthe family associations were talking very much about the *** association the **** ***** ********** ** association and things of these sorts these things dont have the original purpose that they  had in the sense that everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke chinese chinese    did not speak english and they did a lot of extra or judiciary or sort of **** semijudiciary types of functions but they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do chinese consolidated benevolent association still represents ** thirtysome odd associations of chinese people and organizations they do annually the chinese new year parade those type of things are important still to do and we should have the city and continue to encourage that the buildings space **** doesnt have places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which *** is talking about so if the people **** ** arehave gone there and  live there and have a story to tell *** we ought to have a way to *** preserve it and then ** toonce we preserve it to tell it so that the next generation or other people not just *** next generation chinese but other people that are passing through * ***** chinatown know that there are stories created in ***** chinatown that represented the chinese identity or diaspora that happened to be in dc um you had another question unknown speaker 2 yeah speaker 1 yes speaker 2 and as gentrification has occurred in chinatown more and more of the chinese businesses are getting bought up but its like its like the burger joints and whatnot with chinese lettering my question to you is do you is there a fear that with time and with realestate properties going up that eventually small chinese businesses in chinatown will get bought up you know it is looking very and certainly it is a lot more secure than what you see before but how do we keep chinatown chinese speaker 1 correct and so one of the issues there that very much is on top of everybodys mind if you think about ***** chinatown and what makes it its the individual entrepreneurs the mom and pop shops the little things like that that sell the ****** *** and the all that kind of stuff *** *** that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up  there is no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so   for like this and at a certain point those people that operate those businesses like my mom and dad **     they    are getting old and  quit frankly they worked really hard to get you in college so you can get that law degree right and   you are not going to go back there and run  the place so those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things that us that  are looking at property uh the development of china how do we encourage something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed its already gone by right so so im not sure what the real answer is to that it could be city maybe the city has to produce some kind of of tax incentive that allows these things to stay but do you really want to do that do you really want to encourage a small business that doesnt that doesnt really make itself productive or do you have an ordinance that say there should be ** asian related or chinese those are all questions for us *********** ***** my ** feeling just to finish off is that i think i think what we many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop i would like to see big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there it allows us to do those things that make our chinese life significant the wedding the the **** *** the *** chingming festival or something where you bring your family there you have to create so its not so much that small definition of a shop but it is a chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities **** speaker    2 yeah   so weer almost at the end of our time so we got closing comments here speaker namewoman uh yeah i um i agree that it is difficult to have small   business its just not profitable um also i think housing is also a problem thats why people ******  cant afford to live there we have all these expensive condominiums speakerwoman unless you have you   know a high income it seems impossible so but we do have people who do want to live there they want to raise their families there and theres no affordable housing and lowincome housing seems to be disappearing too so theres all sorts of problems and i really dont know ****** what can be done really speaker 1 yeah my fear is that what were going to end up having in ** dc‚Äîbecause of the gentrification and so ***** forth‚Äîis that what were going to end up having is **** a commercial chinatown where we have very few residents living there and that would be a real shame really *** **** ** i think in las vegas they have what they called a chinatown in a mall to me that is not a chinatown really and i think its incumbent upon the city to provide affordable housing right now theres ***** *********    3 billion affordable housing and one looks like its on the chopping block because ******* its such a hot area they want to turn that into a condominium so i dont really know what the answer is basically *** i think at the very least what we **** ** need is an infusion of capital with ******* *** **** we have the foot trafficking area the *** *** area is ** really a hot area now but we need some entrepreneurs with some chinese connections whos willing to invest in the area right now we have ** **** **** businesses like panera starbucks theyre all coming in but the chinese entrepreneurs i think are unwilling to make the investment speaker 2 okay very good **** i think i agree with all that *** *** **** **** *** one point that i did want to emphasize on yours that you know ** i certainly dont want it to be a commercial chinatown **** * **** **** ** ** **** **** none of us want a disneyland atmosphere there **** **** for tourists to come in ***** and gawk at the chinese people there and thats not ***** *** a chinatown *** **** we want it to be meaningful i think what theyre saying is right were ***** going to have help from the city planners to bring in the right businesses and *** ** make the right conditions there to make it work clears throat excuse me *** so ** **** coming to the end here so again i want * **** to read again from **** this quote here   cause i think its very significant that what **** **** bonnie tsui says in  his book here says *** **** the myth of america lies in its patchwork heritage though the united states hasnt always tolerated difference it ********* continues‚Äîto this *** day‚Äîto be built by immigrants *** *** this contradiction ** in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening the birth of cultural pride **** is still evolving visitors of chinatown have a **** role‚Äîwe all have a **** role‚Äîjust as residents do in   a bartering of  culture currency if theres authenticity to be experienced its that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital this is a reminder of what makes america special *** *** ** after a century and a half of chinese immigration chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into america and for americanborn chinese into their chinese heritage and so * thank you all for your attention today and i thank ted walter and *** shirley for their participation here and

      "HYP: ******* * hello hello everyone were getting set up for our next session in      tea   house comments * you are in the china program of the 2014 smithsonian folklife festival ******* * this program is presented through a collaboration by the center for folklife and cultural heritage at the smithsonian with the china international  culture association working with the china arts and entertainment group in beijing ******* * thanks a lot for being here today i dont know if youve noticed but were doing programs slightly different today ******* * the china festival program actually brought over 120 artists and presenters from china to participate in this program ******* * but today were *** doing something a little bit different were calling it diaspora day ******* * there are about four million people of chinese ancestry in the united states and today were celebrating the way in which when people move how they transform and adapt culture community and traditions to the new police places where they end up ******* * so today this this session that were going into right now is one of the programs that is a  part of the diaspora day programming which is also coproduced with the smithsonian asian      pacific american center ******* * so we have ** todays session right now that youre were getting ready to start is the 1882 foundation talk story on the mall and we are going to be talking about china      town today china      town today is the subject of this session ******* * and im going to go ahead and introduce to *** stan  lu who is going to do the presenting and the moderating of this session with our with our experts here today our local experts     and * i want to first introduce you to stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 foundation ******* ******* * so stan  lu sitting right here to my left is a retired civil engineer he used to work for the federal aviation administration and he went to china for the first time in 2003 ******* * 2003 he spent two years two years theres teaching chinese at a university and when he came back to the us he became very interested and committed   to working with chinese american organizations ******* * stan is himself a native of greenville mississippi which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic ** but stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of chinese  american as well as the 1882 foundation ******* * and for those of you who dont know the 1882 foundation is a nonpartisan nonprofit national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the historical impact of chinese exclusion laws ******* * and 1882 specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep chinese immigrants out of the united states and to prevent those who were here already from ever obtaining citizenship ******* * so theyve **** been doing really wonderful work around the country ** and im now going to turn it over to stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel    okay * ** thank you    so     jin * hey ******* * its * pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and we     and this is diaspora day like so   jin was saying here and **** ***** im gonna introduce everybody here     are we gonna were gonna have a conversation and youll get to know who we are because i dont want to spend a whole lot of time going over credentials that it really dont matter ******* * you know what we say is whats gonna be important ******* * so ******* ******* * so this is diaspora day and you know and you know the epitome of diasporos in the united states of course are      china   towns * and thats thats what we think about when when talking about  the display       the chinese who are away from china in the united states  theyre china      towns  is the first  thing   to come to my mind and so you know when we put out our flyer you know we said that you     know that were gonna talk about china      town today and ** but this is not gonna ** be a travel        log by any means you    know we want    to talk about what china      town means to us and ** because like we said in the flyer china      town has different meanings to different people ******* * and one of the references i have ** this book called american    china      towns written by bonnie suey and so ill just read briefly what she says about you know china      town usa ******* * a state of mind a world within a world a  neighborhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine every day ******* * ******* ******* * americans find something different in     china    town * its a place is foreign yet familiar by now quite well known on the western        cultural radar ******* * but splitting the difference still gives many visitors to china      town the sense above all that things are not ******* * ******* ******* * what they seem and popular culture       has been telling us this for decades and its true that few visitors realize just how much goes on beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm ******* * a place with its own deeply felt history and stories of national         cultural significance ******* * so you know our panel today is going to talk about you know what this means to to the apa community chinese        american community from our      from     our viewpoint and then we dont we wont agree on everything because you  know as you as those of you who are *** chinese americans or chinese know that you  know theres very ******* * we argue a lot ******* * so we have differences of opinion about what china      town means to us and we have and certainly the three  panelists here *** we all have our own opinions about it and ** ******* * but one thing that you know and * also what you  in the audience to be thinking about it to you what does china      town mean to you ******* * and you know thats going    to be your takeaway **** for today is come out of this this session here real ** thinking about what china      town means ******* * when you go but  when if youre here in the dc area go to dc china      town and see you know what does it mean to you and you know        and because its changing every day   china towns ********** and so our lowest ** you from out of town go back to your hometowns and and look at the china      towns there and what does   it mean to you      so thats      thats your assignment from     coming from the day but so our our group here one thing we have in common i think is   is that we we all are all abcs ******* * thats american born chinese ******* * so you know we ** have that perspective that     that we arent   were born in this country so we are americans but were awesome but were really definitely chinese americans ******* * were all active in in the dc china      town and we do participate in our talk story events that we have in china      town every month ******* * where we gather the community together   to share stories of our experiences as growing up as chinese americans asian americans ******* * you know and what that means ** and you know we have this monthly in in china      town and so if you want if youre interested in if youre in the area you know talk to us afterwards and well get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are gonna ** be ******* * but for today its china      town its    its talk story on the mall and so im gonna the way were gonna introduce each ourselves is   im gonna go down here and and ask the question you know ******* * what does china      town mean to you ******* * ******* ******* * and how is it important to you ******* * and then you **** tell us who you are you know what ***** your relationship is and then and then ** tell us ******* * ******* ******* * you want to start surely who is   is involved so tell us about who you are and then what and answer the questions     you didnt      do      it okay ** yeah my name is shirley will actually i was born in washington dc and my involvement in china      town is because im the director of the china      town service center which is part of the chinese community church the only chinese community church in washington dc we like to say and actually the reason im here is because another lady   was unable to make it and she really was born and worked in china      town for many years and she had one of the first stores in china      town thats doing in existence today anyway im here to ** be part of this panel and they tell you that china      town is very meaningful to me even though i was born in dc and then my parents used to come to china      town when we were quite young and at that time it was a lot different it was a lot smaller a lot quieter and it was a way for people to meet people like themselves   to speak their languages to have a cup of tea to go over old news about what was happening in china what was going on in america and i think its important to me because it is a community even though we think of it as maybe just a place people come to eat or its a touristy place but there are real residents that live there and its important i think to maintain that ****** ** ***** *** ******* my name is walter wu im shirleys       husband and i also help at the chinatown service center which is a part of the chinese community church which is located in the heart of chinatown this  is thats where we worship i am an abc and american born chinese i was born in texas a transplant here in 1972 and in san antonio we didnt have a chinatown and i think for that reason i have a special appreciation if not a greater appreciation of chinatown even though the one in dc its quite small as compared lets say to the ones in new york or san francisco or los angeles we tutor immigrants with their help them improve their english on saturday  morning we have a program and we also help them with their citizenship and we know how valuable that the residents of fine living in chinatown is you know we you may go to chinatown and it may have shrunk in terms of the commercial chinatown in terms of the number of restaurants but i think you will see   you find a significant number of chinese that live there they they live in mainly in three public housing projects located not that far from the heart of chinatown so i think the when we help not just ourselves but we have  other two ** have one of our tutors actually whos here whos been a longtime tutor at our saturday program and i think the reward that we get is that when we help immigrants improve their english or help them in some way we can see the smile on their face we can see the appreciation and we can see the gratitude that they have and chinatown what it is its it provides an instant a community for the chinese to ** fellowship with other chinese and with similar language so its really a * very key part in helping assimilate into this country ******* * ** so my name    is ted gong im im from california and everybodys using these terms abc ******* * and im abc and americanborn chinese but as you guys all know probably theres always like hip hong kong instant product mit made in taiwan all that kind of stuff like this but abc and when i im ***** about a fourth or fifth      generation chinese from california from fresno anybody from fresno anybody know fresno ****** ****** ***** fresno and we of course didnt have a chinatown there and the chinatown that we always go to is either san francisco primarily or to los angeles ******* * and you know the thing about growing up in the rural california is i think theres probably like one or two other chinese families in my town mostly we pick i was just talking with somebody about picking ** cotton you know *** the long cotton bags and you    drag the cotton bags and    do things like this but you would always my mom and dad ran a grocery store in in      a little tiny grocery store in rosie california near dainuba california which is there fresno but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always say weve got    to go to daifu daifu san francisco chinatown you have to go back to buy the groceries to get to talk to the to the family folk to have the banquets to have the weddings and so   for so chinatown has that meaning as well it is a place in which you rejuvenate in many levels one to get the groceries that you cant get in rural california to get the food or the banquet that familiar taste to talk with those relatives to have those banquets and those meals and so forth chinatown historically and this dc     china has had that same purpose has changed over     originally a place for immigrants to come     still is a place for immigrants to come to get the skills the language get used to the america america so that they can go off and do better things in before chinatown has other purposes during the exclusion acts we talk about the 1882 exclusion act chinatowns  are actually a protective place you know in 8200 ***** and so forth if you were chinese in * rural part of california during the time when the chinese exclusion acts was going on the explosion period you could be killed you know and chinatown was a protective enclave that is the place where chinatowns gather together *** protect themselves in california just to let you know after the exclusion acts and the period which they call the expulsion period there were officially 200 roundups of chinese rural chinese   kick out of the areas or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge chinese from the districts and  chinatown   function as a place a protective place later on it becomes a place where immigrants get skills later on it becomes a place where people are able to move from there to other parts of the community like in dc here the original dc chinatown here does anybody know where the original dc chinatown was  is  a federal triangle the original chinatown was   a federal triangle and its expect       it was then pushed off to where it is now and its now constricted to where it is so it continues to evolve but there     is something about chinatown that is different there is a sense that chinatown is a place where you can get identity its linked with chinese        american identity its linked with our culture its linked with a desire to go back like myself to find those things which make up our culture and our identity chinatown can be a concept as well as a place ******* * very good very good so yeah i think  all all three of you what you said is ** you know right on its **** its different theres different views of what chinatown is ******* * and again im gonna ** quote from this book here because i think it has some great quotes in it here the truth is that chinatown is a space of selfinvention ******* * the oldest chinese immigrants including but not limited to those who landed in the port cities of new york san francisco los angeles honolulu ******* * had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large ******* * these days new immigrants continue to come for a new life and a search for and a search for a cultural identity brings chinese        americans of many generations back to walk alongside them ******* * and i guess you know i kind    of   fall in that latter category about looking for myself     identity ******* * because you know what chinatown means to me is you know i feel good there for some reason ******* * you know i cant explain it because you know my upbringing was was such that i grew up in mississippi like so   jen said during the 40s and 50s during extremely a bad time there ******* * where i ** ** was just not fun being chinese you know we were picked on we were abused and we couldnt go to schools with anybody else    we **** had to build a oneroom schoolhouse ******* * for us where we had all of our    all the families in the city of greenville in one school       house  and  house all 12 grades with one teacher ******* * so you know for    that was kind of *** life i was brought up with and so i said hey its no fun being chinese ******* * im not gonna ** be chinese so i * you know i literally rejected my heritage ran away from it you know   try to forget who i was     and and ****** so my long journey back     so im on    a journey of selfdiscovery now because i ***** ** think ive come back you know im proud to be chinese        american now and its part of and   chinatowns a part of my    help * ****** me in finding myself     identity and that and thats      i think thats a very key part of what why were espousing what     the importance of chinatowns here for me because theres *** a personal journey i think its a personal journey for all of us here in the community and so you know      i would like to ask you know walter and shirley     you know you know as you grew up you know maybe youre growing up wasnt as drastic as mine    you ******* * * **** ******* know i didnt handle it well me **** *** probably  handle it the better than i did but you know so how did that influence you know how you *** review chinatowns now and and you know what was it mean    youre growing up   even though you didnt grow up in a chinatown ******* * ** ******* * ******* *** *** *** ** ******* ** **** ** yeah i grew up in dc ** actually ** we had a laundry in southeast  near    i    guess over the bridge pennsylvania avenue and at that time in the schools i went to elumentary and even miller school there werent that many asians so of course i    was stood out therell ***** ***** be like maybe one other girl who might be chinese and then she moved away not ** be only asian person there and my friends were always to be amazed at the beginning of school year how teachers would always remember my name but of course you know i was the only person who was asian *** you know had black hair black eyes or whatever so i was     im ** aware that im chinese im different from my caucasian friends even though they probably didnt look at me that way which was good but i always knew that i was different you know my food was different at home i didnt eat sandwiches like they did *** *** **** we always had rice at lunchtime you know it was just different you know i had to stay in and  we know we had a laundry and you know *** their parents living ** a house and so my dream was someday *** that i was gonna have a house too and have and be like that dick and jane book and have a dog and a cat and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay home ****** *** anyway we do have a house so i did look be able to lift this american dream but yeah im always aware that im chinese and chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to to meet their friends again you know to talk to meet people of their same languages and thats thats always important for everybody ******* * ****** *** well my background was entirely different       i * i grew up in texas   actors * *** born in san antonio  were the major population ** hispanic ******* * so there really werent that many chinese there and so      it you know we  did    what chinese food we ate was was from my mothers cooking at home basically ****** you know so we didnt have a chinatown ******* * or anything like that  we visit relatives for **** chinese and so forth and that was about the extent of the chinese population ******* * so when i came to washington dc to work in 1972   end up staying because i met my wife here ******* * but i remember when i visited new york city for the first time during chinese new year ******* * i was just so mesmerized by the number of chinese in new york chinatown ******* * i mean to me it was so impressive to see so many chinese there   i was thrilled to death really       i * i never experienced something like that so     its great really it its a its a great thrill you know to be among other chinese and to see       go into a chinatown ******* * where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth and theyre all were so thriving really so it really was an eyeopening experience for me and its something that i always will appreciate and even though the dc chinatown is relatively small ******* * but i think we both love it in terms of trying to we identify sure         my wife shirley and i you know were first      generation were born here so we identify very much with what the immigrants are going through and so our church has a chinatown service center that caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth so we both are very very involved with that we have a program that where we tutor immigrants with their english and help them with their citizenship so for both of us has been very very rewarding ******* * so i mean so what what is the aura about chinatown  and makes chinatown a chinatown you know as as so you know what is it were talking a lot of intangibles here it seems like but **** a lot of real stuff too but but there are lots of intangibles would you say that  read **** that ted    yeah * *** so so i hope that there is actually i hope that other people can contribute some ideas *********** as well the idea of a chinatown is where the  what i remember one person one time somebody asked me he says that he says why should we   should we ** should we not preserve chinatown this is actually a boston urban planner * chinatown urban planner and he says you know thats a bit thats a philosophical question if you ask me how do you preserve chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and the constructions and the  sites and so forth well thats a question i can answer as an engineer or a designer but if you ask me should we or should we not preserve chinatown then thats a question of a lot philosophical question and im not sure all of us have the right answer to that another person said to me that says chinatown is where the chinese people are if thats the case then if you use the dc example **** there are not that many chinese residents physically people living in chinatown anymore many more are moving toward rockville everybody knows that if youre *** talking about where the food is there are good chinese restaurants in chinatown there are others and even more than other places       in maryland  in different places of this sort they in new york you talk about not just one chinatown  a mott street you talk about three or four chinatowns because the different congregations of people and their restaurants have moved in philadelphia the restaurants have moved and so forth and and so on so what is it that makes chinatown chinatown and where things are think about it again right now there are more chinese festivals being done in the urban  area    so you have these big festivals being done say at tysons corner or oak ** at one of the malls and they have these great dances all day long for chinese new year or   for qingming and you  will go there and everybody  will celebrate those things and learn a little bit *** eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about chinese culture but you would never say that tysons corner or fair oaks mall is chinatown which you would never say that right but and you would have a hard time saying just because theres a concentration of people in rockville that rockville is chinatown theres something about that term chinatown in these historical chinatowns that make makes   it what it is and im not sure what it is its ******* ** ***** ***** a      yes yes * ****** ********** ** ******* * yes yes so but at the same time so he is saying that how do you how how do you keep a chinatown in the country ** * ******* **** ** as diverse as the united states is that raises another interesting question everybody else other ethnic groups have their own barrios their own fishermens   war for something ** this sort should all those places be preserved separately as we grow ** we **** ** remember that i was raised and say a part of new york city but i dont necessarily want to maintain that area if i were raised in the projects in detroit thats defined my character and stuff but i dont        want this or preserve that that that that building right but why is it then that do we want to preserve    a chinatown area do we have any answers to that    yeah * *** who has answers to that you know my own my own  answer somewhat is i agree i mean it is its hard when to answer but you know im saying that you know what i what i read what i read earlier is that that chinatown you know has his own deeply filled history and stories of national cultural significance and i think one of the things about chinatown is it was a protective area for us as opposed to you know this is where we had to be and i think you know theres lots of stories there that need to be preserved you know if not the structures of themselves then the stories that go behind know why these china why were chinatowns there i think thats ** important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about you know why were these why did that the the chinese population retreat into these chinatowns and and and they got the reputation           its not because that you know they wanted to per  se but but then they were they were kind of forced into that area and they persevered there and i think thats how they became a stronger community it made for a sense of community and i think that that kind of history is there i dont know i dont know if you disagree or not agree with me walter or so     you so part of the community is part of it is the community the current community there the   historic community but part of it is sort of the hollywood myth of chinatown who you know you have chinatown movies you have everybody you talk about the for better or worse whether its the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this chinatown evokes an image that i think other other i think communities dont necessarily evoke and its both positive and negative for the chinese americans yeah immersion * and culture ******* ********* i **** ** ** ******** **** **** *** **** ***** ***** ** ****** **** *** **** **** ***** ** ***** **** *** ***** ** * ***** ***** ************ ******* *** *** *** ***** ******* *** ** * think thats what       why **** *** ***** ***** **** ** * ******* ****** *** **** **** **** **** ***** ** ******* ** **** ******* ******* * ******* * ******* is that so one of the things shes saying is that growing up ** oklahoma you come back much like stan is saying or walter is saying you come in and suddenly you surround it by ** things that your parents or grandparents  or that kind    of stuff that ***** happens and that gives you another sense of ** * part of your identity  in history but why is that that you get that from a chinatown and not from say going to the chinese historical museum in new york or the  inju island museum and why is it that its a chinatown     that does that that place ******* *********** * ******* * **** **** i think its just an aura there     that does that because   i agree that what youre saying there because you  know i dont speak chinese you  know so   you know people say they go to chinese because they *** hear people speaking theyre saying     like i dont understand a word thats being said there  by chinese people there since so you  know and i  can say **** i ran away from my chinese heritage  so i really dont identify but somehow when im there you   know i feel like hey staying ** your home and something is  it you  know i use the term  is a cultural touchstone for me ** in my personal journey and i think it i think that resonates with lots *** of people like me who whove had us whove kind of run away from their identity or *** not sure what their identity is because the duality that we chinese americans face in this country you know you know living especially second generation people like us  theyre       a ** ********** ***** generation fourth generation ******* * yeah yeah i think for those who chinese americans who are born here you know we may tend to view chinatown more ** in the abstract as something that has enduring meaning and i think it does because its its a part of our history and so forth but i but i think theres ** another level which is much more basic and * ***** that is for the immigrants  who come you know they seek comfort in like kind  language  in other people whove **** had experiences just like them and so it to me its its its very very basic really its security for immigrants   who come and i think when you find someone who is sharing somewhat the same experience that youre *** about to embark on it provides a tremendous amount of comfort and security so in even in dc chinatown when we look at it we may find that it seemed to be relatively small but really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants i think it means so much to them and i think we see that in our interaction at the chinatown service center the immigrants  who come in for help sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation   to get something in the mail *** they dont know what this is so you can i think what we always try to do is put put ourselves in an immigrants place imagine if you were to go to china and know not a word of chinese and then how would you cope and so i think that is the attitude that we take when we assist immigrants who come to the chinatown service center seeking help **** ** sounds like thats thats   a real toughy kirk  you know     shes    asking   you    know     how do  how ****** ********** ******** do *** **** *** ******** ** *** we *** ******** ********* *** ***** *** **** *** ******** *** ******* **** *** ********* **** ***** ******* ***** *** ******** ********* ******* ********** ******* **** ******** ******* * ***** * **** ******* **** ** you know  i announced *** *** ** ** *** the question i really want to present here as sort of our assignment you know how how do we do this how how do we maintain because youre not gonna  youre not you know dc chinatown its not gonna ** have a lot of residents again you know and like like san francisco where youre selling fish you know on the open market there and things like that and and a lot of people living there and speaking the language in chinese and in dialects and so forth so thats a hard one to answer you know how do we preserve this this feeling here and preserve this most of all the history thats been there and and the and the people who  live there   play their    life and   cry there the whole thing      so so so part part of it is you do have to maintain the physical appearance of the time that boundaries   to define it whether its the architecture the little whether or not theyre bona fide architecture is another question but theres something that allows it to be distinct so in dc chinatown for example shops have to have chinese characters on their windows right and so those kind of things seem superficial but they are still important enough to help define that space then what you do in that space is important what are the activities that you do there do you allow the family associations to continue to operate there does the city given enough         a family  association **** talking very much about the lee association the more youre associated on        long and things of these sorts these things dont have the original purpose that they have in the sense that everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke chinese chinese nights  be ***** english and they did a lot of extra or judiciary or sort of semi     judiciary  type of functions but they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do chinese  consolidate benevolent association still represents 30       some odd associations of chinese people and organizations they do annually the chinese new year parade those type of things are important still to do and we should have the city and continue to encourage that the  building space does     it have places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which tan is talking about so if the people have or    have gone there and lived there and have a story to tell and we ought to have a way to his preserve it and then to   once we preserve it to tell it so that the next generation or other people not just the next generation chinese but other people  who are passing through a giant      town know that there are stories created in china      town that represented the chinese identity or diaspora that happened to be in dc ** you had another question ******* ******* * **** ******* * yes       i i *** ** ************** *** ******** ** ********* **** *** **** ** *** ******* ********** *** ******* ****** ** *** *** **** *** **** *** ****** ****** *** ******* **** ******* ********* ** ******** ** *** ** ** *** ** ***** * **** **** **** **** *** **** ********** ********** ***** ** **** ********** ***** ******* ********** ** ********* **** *** ****** ** *** **** ** ** ******* **** *** ********* ** ** * *** **** ****** **** **** *** *** ****** *** *** ** ** **** ********* ******* ******* * correct and so one of the issues there that very much is on top of everybodys mind if you think about china      town and what makes it its the individual entrepreneurs the mom and pop shops the little things like that   to sell the chashu bow and the all that kind of stuff did you that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up theres ** no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so forth like this and at a certain point those people that operate those businesses **** my mom and dad or somebody theyre getting old and quite frankly they worked really hard to get you in college so you *** get that law degree right and youre *** not gonna ** go back there and run that place so those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things   as us  who have looking at property as the development ** china how do we encourage something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed its already gone by right so so im not sure what the real answer is to that it could be city maybe the city has to produce some kind of ** tax incentive that allows these things to stay but do you really want to do that do you really want to encourage a small business that doesnt that doesnt really make itself productive or do you have ** ordinance **** say there should be an asian related ** chinese those are all questions for us practically today my my feeling just to finish off is that i think i think what we many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop i would like to see big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there it allows us to do those things that make our chinese life significant the wedding the the moon you the the  qingming festival or something where you bring your family there you have to create so its not so much that small definition of a shop but it is a chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities yeah      so well yeah were **** almost at the end of our time so we get closing comments here ******* ********* ** **** * ** * ***** **** it is difficult to have small businesses its just not profitable it also i think housing is also a problem thats why people cannot paint afford to live there we have all these expensive condominiums ************ unless you have   a little a high income it seems impossible so but we do have people who do want to live there they want to raise their families there and theres no affordable housing and lowincome housing  seem to be disappearing too so theres all sorts of problems and i really dont know really what can be done really ******* * yeah my fear is that what were gonna ** end up having in dc    because of the gentrification and so forth       is that what   we ***** ** end up having is just a commercial chinatown where we have very few residents living there and that would be a real shame really you know we i think in las vegas they have what they   call a chinatown in a mall to me that is not a chinatown really and i think its incumbent upon the city to provide affordable housing right now theres three buildings that     are affordable housing and one looks like its on the chopping block because because its such a hot area they want to turn that into a condominium so i dont ****** know what the answer is basically but i think at the very least what we know we need is an infusion of capital with because you know we have  to  put     traffic   in the air the area is is really a hot area now but we need some entrepreneurs with some chinese connections whos willing to invest in the area right now we have we have this         is like panera starbucks theyre all coming in but the chinese entrepreneurs i think are unwilling to make the investment ******* * okay very good yeah i think i agree with all that and you know that the one point that i did want to emphasize on yours that you know we i certainly dont want it to be a commercial chinatown yeah i dont want to we dont know none of us want a disneyland atmosphere there were just for tourists to come in there and gawk at the chinese people there and thats not thats not a chinatown you know we want it to be meaningful i think what theyre saying is right were gonna  have to help help from the city planners to bring in the right businesses and and to make the right conditions there to make it work ****** ****** excuse me but so so were coming to the end here so again i want i want to read again from from this quote here because i think its very significant that what what what bonnie suey says in this book here says you know the myth of america lies in its patchwork heritage though the united states hasnt always tolerated difference it continues           to this day     to be built by immigrants the cut this contradiction is in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening the birth of cultural pride that is still evolving visitors in chinatown have a role     you all have a role      just as residents do in the bartering of cultural currency if theres authenticity to be experienced its that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital  its ** a reminder of what makes america special and and so after a century and a half of chinese immigration chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into america and for americanborn chinese into their chinese heritage and so i thank you all for your attention today and i think ted walter and and shirley for their participation here and really i said you guys got a year   of     silence  then you   help us out   help us with chinatowns you know make it make it work for us here were make it work for you too thank you ******* * **** ** dont go too far away because starting in just a few **** minutes well have another panel discussion this one entitled young historians living histories so starting in * just a few minutes as we get set up young historians living histories yeah yeah no **** ****** **** *** **** *** so id like to welcome you to day number five of the 2014 smithsonian folklife festival today is diaspora day and thats diaspora day both for the\n",
