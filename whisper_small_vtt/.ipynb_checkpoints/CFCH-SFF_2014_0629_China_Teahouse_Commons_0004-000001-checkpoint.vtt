00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Hello, hello everyone. We're getting set up for our next session in tea house comments. You are in the

00:07.040 --> 00:10.880
China program of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife Festival

00:10.960 --> 00:18.640
This program is presented through a collaboration by the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian with the China

00:19.040 --> 00:21.040
International Culture Association

00:21.200 --> 00:26.600
Working with the China Arts and Entertainment Group in Beijing. Thanks a lot for being here today

00:26.600 --> 00:33.080
I don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different today the China Festival program actually brought over

00:33.600 --> 00:39.600
120 artists and presenters from China to participate in this program, but today we're doing something a little bit different

00:39.600 --> 00:41.360
We're calling it diaspora day

00:41.360 --> 00:45.880
There are about four million people of Chinese ancestry in the United States and today

00:45.880 --> 00:53.080
We're celebrating the way in which when people move how they transform and adapt culture community and traditions to the new

00:53.080 --> 00:59.280
Police places where they end up so today this this session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is a part of the

00:59.280 --> 01:04.640
diaspora day programming which is also co-produced with the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center

01:05.080 --> 01:13.600
So we have today's session right now that you're we're getting ready to start is the 1882 foundation talk story on the mall

01:13.600 --> 01:17.400
And we are going to be talking about China town today

01:17.720 --> 01:20.220
China town today is the subject of this session

01:20.220 --> 01:26.800
And I'm going to go ahead and introduce to Stan Lu who is going to do the presenting and the moderating of this session

01:26.880 --> 01:29.720
With our with our experts here today our local experts

01:29.720 --> 01:35.920
And I want to first introduce you to Stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 foundation

01:36.600 --> 01:41.840
So Stan Lu sitting right here to my left is a retired civil engineer

01:41.840 --> 01:47.920
He used to work for the Federal Aviation Administration and he went to China for the first time in 2003

01:48.920 --> 01:51.640
2003 he spent two years two years there's

01:51.920 --> 01:58.480
Teaching Chinese at a university and when he came back to the US he became very interested and committed to working with Chinese American

01:58.680 --> 02:01.680
Organizations Stan is himself a native of Greenville, Mississippi

02:02.600 --> 02:05.780
Which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic

02:06.720 --> 02:11.320
But Stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of Chinese American

02:12.120 --> 02:18.360
as well as the 1882 foundation and for those of you who don't know the 1882 foundation is a

02:19.240 --> 02:20.760
nonpartisan non-profit

02:20.760 --> 02:26.360
national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the

02:26.800 --> 02:29.520
historical impact of Chinese exclusion laws and

02:30.280 --> 02:31.320
1882

02:31.320 --> 02:38.240
specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep Chinese immigrants out of the United States and to prevent

02:38.240 --> 02:41.200
Those who were here already from ever obtaining citizenship

02:41.320 --> 02:43.880
So they've been doing really wonderful work around the country

02:44.240 --> 02:49.640
And I'm now going to turn it over to Stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel. Okay. Thank you

02:49.640 --> 02:55.560
So Jin hey, it's pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and

02:56.320 --> 03:03.280
We and this is diaspora day like so Jin was saying here and I'm gonna introduce everybody here

03:03.280 --> 03:04.480
Are we gonna?

03:04.480 --> 03:10.080
We're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are because I don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over

03:10.280 --> 03:14.760
Credentials that it really don't matter, you know, what we say is what's gonna be important

03:14.880 --> 03:19.400
So so this is diaspora day and you know and you know the epitome of

03:19.920 --> 03:27.080
Diasporos in the United States of course are China towns and that's that's what we think about when when talking about the display

03:27.080 --> 03:30.160
The Chinese who are away from China in the United States

03:30.160 --> 03:35.520
They're China towns is the first thing to come to my mind and so, you know when we put out our flyer

03:35.960 --> 03:40.480
You know we said that you know that we're gonna talk about China town today

03:40.480 --> 03:44.840
And but this is not gonna be a travel log by any means, you know

03:44.840 --> 03:47.560
we want to talk about what China town means to us and

03:48.840 --> 03:56.780
Because like we said in the flyer China town has different meanings to different people and one of the references I have this book called

03:58.120 --> 04:02.080
American China towns written by Bonnie Suey and so I'll just

04:03.080 --> 04:10.480
Read briefly what she says about you know China town USA a state of mind a world within a world a

04:10.960 --> 04:13.680
Neighborhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine

04:14.520 --> 04:16.520
every day

04:16.960 --> 04:19.720
Americans find something different in China town

04:20.400 --> 04:26.600
It's a place is foreign yet familiar by now quite well known on the Western cultural radar

04:26.800 --> 04:34.600
But splitting the difference still gives many visitors to China town the sense above all that things are not

04:35.880 --> 04:37.880
what they seem and

04:38.360 --> 04:40.880
Popular culture has been telling us this for decades

04:40.880 --> 04:45.880
And it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on

04:46.400 --> 04:52.960
Beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm a place with its own deeply felt history and

04:53.560 --> 05:00.920
Stories of national cultural significance, so you know our panel today is going to talk about you know what this means to

05:01.680 --> 05:10.560
To the APA community Chinese American community from our from our viewpoint and then we don't we won't agree on everything because you know as you as

05:10.560 --> 05:12.240
those of you who are

05:12.240 --> 05:16.280
Chinese Americans or Chinese know that you know there's very

05:16.960 --> 05:21.760
We argue a lot, so we have differences of opinion about what China town means to us

05:22.120 --> 05:25.640
And we have and certainly the three panelists here

05:26.160 --> 05:30.960
We all have our own opinions about it and but one thing that you know

05:30.960 --> 05:33.680
And also what you in the audience to be thinking about it to you

05:33.680 --> 05:37.800
What does China town mean to you and you know that's going to be your takeaway for today

05:38.160 --> 05:44.360
Is come out of this this session here real thinking about what China town means when you go

05:44.360 --> 05:48.560
But when if you're here in the DC area go to DC China town and see you know

05:48.560 --> 05:53.280
What does it mean to you and you know and because it's changing every day

05:53.680 --> 06:00.040
China towns and so our lowest you from out of town go back to your hometowns and and look at the China towns there

06:00.040 --> 06:04.600
And what does it mean to you? So that's that's your assignment from coming from the day

06:04.800 --> 06:13.000
But so our our group here one thing we have in common. I think is is that we we all are all ABCs

06:13.720 --> 06:19.520
That's American born Chinese. So, you know, we have that perspective that that we aren't

06:20.840 --> 06:24.360
We're born in this country. So we are Americans, but we're awesome

06:24.360 --> 06:26.480
But we're really definitely Chinese Americans

06:26.480 --> 06:33.360
We're all active in in the DC China town and we do participate in our talk story events that we have in China town

06:33.600 --> 06:40.000
Every month where we gather the community together to share stories of our experiences as

06:40.600 --> 06:45.800
Growing up as Chinese Americans Asian Americans, you know and what that means and you know

06:45.800 --> 06:52.120
We have this monthly in in China town and so if you want if you're interested in if you're in the area, you know

06:52.760 --> 06:57.240
Talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are gonna be

06:57.280 --> 06:59.280
But for today, it's China town

06:59.960 --> 07:03.560
It's it's talk story on the mall and so I'm gonna

07:04.080 --> 07:09.840
The way we're gonna introduce each ourselves is I'm gonna go down here and and ask the question

07:10.320 --> 07:11.760
you know

07:11.760 --> 07:14.280
What does China town mean to you and

07:15.440 --> 07:18.920
How is it important to you and then you tell us who you are?

07:18.920 --> 07:25.920
You know what your relationship is and then and then tell us you want to start surely who

07:26.960 --> 07:31.720
Is is involved so tell us about who you are and then what and answer the questions

07:31.720 --> 07:33.720
You didn't do it. Okay

07:35.160 --> 07:37.160
Yeah, my name is Shirley will

07:37.840 --> 07:44.560
Actually, I was born in Washington DC and my involvement in China town is because I'm the director of the China town service center

07:44.680 --> 07:46.800
Which is part of the Chinese community church

07:47.160 --> 07:52.640
The only Chinese community church in Washington DC we like to say and actually the reason I'm here is because

07:53.440 --> 07:54.880
another lady

07:54.880 --> 08:00.000
Was unable to make it and she really was born and worked in China town for many years

08:00.000 --> 08:04.160
And she had one of the first stores in China town that's doing in existence today

08:04.880 --> 08:12.200
Anyway, I'm here to be part of this panel and they tell you that China town is very meaningful to me even though

08:12.200 --> 08:17.840
I was born in DC and then my parents used to come to China town when we were quite young and

08:18.280 --> 08:22.000
At that time it was a lot different. It was a lot smaller a lot quieter

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
And it was a way for people to meet people like themselves to speak their languages to have a cup of tea

08:29.360 --> 08:32.320
To go over old news about what was happening in China

08:32.600 --> 08:38.000
What was going on in America and I think it's important to me because it is a community even though

08:38.200 --> 08:40.760
We think of it as maybe just a place

08:41.240 --> 08:43.600
People come to eat or it's a touristy place

08:43.920 --> 08:48.520
But there are real residents that live there and it's important. I think to maintain that

08:51.880 --> 08:55.320
My name is Walter Wu. I'm Shirley's husband

08:55.840 --> 08:57.840
and I also

08:58.240 --> 09:03.440
Help at the Chinatown service center, which is a part of the Chinese Community Church

09:03.440 --> 09:06.720
Which is located in the heart of Chinatown. This is that's where we worship

09:07.720 --> 09:14.880
I am an ABC and American born Chinese. I was born in Texas a transplant here in 1972

09:14.880 --> 09:21.640
And in San Antonio, we didn't have a Chinatown and I think for that reason I have a

09:22.160 --> 09:28.680
Special appreciation if not a greater appreciation of Chinatown even though the one in DC

09:28.680 --> 09:35.840
It's quite small as compared let's say to the ones in New York or San Francisco or Los Angeles

09:36.800 --> 09:42.120
We tutor immigrants with their help them improve their English on Saturday morning

09:42.120 --> 09:48.120
We have a program and we also help them with their citizenship and we know how valuable that the

09:48.600 --> 09:51.320
Residents of fine living in Chinatown is

09:51.960 --> 09:55.720
You know we you may go to Chinatown and it may have shrunk

09:56.080 --> 09:59.840
In terms of the commercial Chinatown in terms of the number of restaurants

10:00.000 --> 10:05.580
But I think you will see you find a significant number of Chinese that live there

10:05.580 --> 10:10.080
They they live in mainly in three public housing projects

10:10.600 --> 10:12.600
Located not that far from the heart of Chinatown

10:13.840 --> 10:16.560
So I think the when we help

10:17.280 --> 10:22.940
Not just ourselves, but we have other two have one of our tutors actually who's here who's been a longtime tutor

10:23.320 --> 10:28.960
At our Saturday program and I think the reward that we get is that when we help

10:29.520 --> 10:34.520
Immigrants improve their English or help them in some way we can see the smile on their face

10:34.520 --> 10:40.280
We can see the appreciation and we can see the gratitude that they have and Chinatown

10:40.440 --> 10:45.600
What it is it's it provides an instant a community for the Chinese to

10:46.560 --> 10:50.600
Fellowship with other Chinese and with similar language

10:50.600 --> 10:56.060
So it's really a very key part in helping assimilate into this country

10:58.160 --> 11:00.400
So my name is Ted Gong I'm

11:01.600 --> 11:07.200
I'm from California and everybody's using these terms ABC and I'm ABC and

11:07.640 --> 11:12.520
American-born Chinese but as you guys all know probably there's always like HIP

11:12.960 --> 11:14.800
Hong Kong instant product

11:14.920 --> 11:18.000
MIT made in Taiwan all that kind of stuff like this, but

11:19.000 --> 11:24.520
ABC and when I I'm about a fourth or fifth generation Chinese from California from Fresno

11:24.520 --> 11:27.040
Anybody from Fresno anybody know Fresno?

11:31.040 --> 11:35.600
Fresno and we of course didn't have a Chinatown there and the Chinatown that we

11:36.040 --> 11:38.100
always go to is either San Francisco

11:39.120 --> 11:41.520
primarily or to Los Angeles and

11:41.800 --> 11:50.040
You know the thing about growing up in the rural California is I think there's probably like one or two other Chinese families in my town

11:51.440 --> 11:54.440
Mostly we pick I was just talking with somebody about picking

11:55.720 --> 12:00.120
Cotton you know the long cotton bags and you drag the cotton bags and do things like this

12:00.120 --> 12:06.160
But you would always my mom and dad ran a grocery store in in a little tiny grocery store in

12:06.440 --> 12:14.760
Rosie, California near Dainuba, California, which is there Fresno, but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always say we've got to go to

12:16.040 --> 12:18.880
Daifu Daifu San Francisco Chinatown

12:18.880 --> 12:27.920
You have to go back to buy the groceries to get to talk to the to the family folk to have the banquets to have the weddings and so

12:27.920 --> 12:33.360
For so Chinatown has that meaning as well. It is a place in which you rejuvenate

12:33.800 --> 12:38.560
In many levels one to get the groceries that you can't get in rural, California

12:39.240 --> 12:42.760
to get the food or the banquet that familiar taste to

12:43.440 --> 12:49.000
Talk with those relatives to have those banquets and those meals and so forth Chinatown

12:50.520 --> 12:53.300
Historically and this DC China has had that same

12:54.640 --> 12:56.400
Purpose has

12:56.480 --> 13:00.280
Changed over originally a place for immigrants to come

13:00.720 --> 13:05.880
Still is a place for immigrants to come to get the skills the language get used to

13:07.120 --> 13:11.720
the America America so that they can go off and do better things in

13:13.120 --> 13:20.960
Before Chinatown has other purposes during the exclusion acts we talk about the 1882 exclusion act Chinatown's are actually a protective place

13:21.560 --> 13:23.560
You know in

13:24.480 --> 13:26.480
8200 and so forth if you

13:26.960 --> 13:28.960
were Chinese in

13:29.800 --> 13:37.320
Rural part of California during the time when the Chinese exclusion acts was going on the explosion period you could be killed

13:37.560 --> 13:40.840
You know and Chinatown was a protective enclave

13:41.280 --> 13:46.920
That is the place where Chinatown's gather together protect themselves in California just to let you know

13:47.920 --> 13:53.940
After the exclusion acts and the period which they call the Expulsion period

13:54.240 --> 13:58.960
There were officially 200 roundups of Chinese rural Chinese

13:59.320 --> 14:05.120
Kick out of the areas or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge

14:05.640 --> 14:08.680
Chinese from the districts and Chinatown function as a place a

14:09.240 --> 14:16.560
Protective place later on it becomes a place where immigrants get skills later on it becomes a place where people are

14:16.920 --> 14:21.240
able to move from there to other parts of the community like in DC here

14:22.160 --> 14:29.120
The original DC Chinatown here does anybody know where the original DC Chinatown was is a federal triangle

14:29.480 --> 14:34.980
The original Chinatown was a federal triangle and it's expect it was then pushed off to where it is now

14:34.980 --> 14:38.720
And it's now constricted to where it is so it continues to evolve

14:39.000 --> 14:44.080
But there is something about Chinatown that is different. There is a sense that Chinatown

14:44.680 --> 14:50.920
Is a place where you can get identity it's linked with Chinese American identity. It's linked with our

14:51.640 --> 14:55.360
Culture it's linked with a desire to go back like myself

14:55.960 --> 15:00.040
To find those things which make up our culture and our identity

15:00.360 --> 15:04.720
Chinatown can be a concept as well as a place very good very good

15:04.720 --> 15:09.360
So yeah, I think all all three of you what you said is you know, right on

15:09.480 --> 15:11.000
It's it's different

15:11.000 --> 15:13.920
There's different views of what Chinatown is and again

15:13.920 --> 15:18.080
I'm gonna quote from this book here because I think it has some great quotes in it here

15:18.080 --> 15:21.320
The truth is that Chinatown is a space of self-invention

15:22.080 --> 15:28.640
The oldest Chinese immigrants including but not limited to those who landed in the port cities of New York San Francisco

15:28.960 --> 15:35.400
Los Angeles Honolulu had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large

15:35.960 --> 15:43.640
These days new immigrants continue to come for a new life and a search for and a search for a cultural identity

15:44.520 --> 15:49.700
Brings Chinese Americans of many generations back to walk alongside them

15:49.700 --> 15:56.560
And I guess you know I kind of fall in that latter category about looking for myself identity because you know

15:56.560 --> 16:01.620
What Chinatown means to me is you know, I feel good there for some reason, you know

16:01.620 --> 16:07.460
I can't explain it because you know my upbringing was was such that I

16:07.980 --> 16:14.620
Grew up in Mississippi like so Jen said during the 40s and 50s during extremely a bad time there

16:14.620 --> 16:20.100
Where I was just not fun being Chinese, you know, we were picked on we were abused

16:20.540 --> 16:24.180
And we couldn't go to schools with anybody else

16:24.180 --> 16:28.380
We had to build a one-room schoolhouse for us where we had all of our

16:29.260 --> 16:36.020
All the families in the city of Greenville in one school house and house all 12 grades with one teacher

16:36.540 --> 16:42.820
So, you know for that was kind of life. I was brought up with and so I said, hey, it's no fun being Chinese

16:42.820 --> 16:44.820
I'm not gonna be Chinese. So I

16:44.820 --> 16:52.100
You know, I literally rejected my heritage ran away from it, you know, try to forget who I was and and so

16:52.500 --> 16:58.340
My long journey back so I'm on a journey of self-discovery now because I think I've come back

16:58.460 --> 17:04.460
You know, I'm proud to be Chinese American now and it's part of and Chinatown's a part of my

17:04.820 --> 17:10.460
Help me in finding myself identity and that and that's I think that's a very key part of

17:10.980 --> 17:18.460
What why we're espousing what the importance of Chinatown's here for me because there's a personal journey

17:18.460 --> 17:24.300
I think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community and so, you know, I would like to ask

17:24.580 --> 17:26.580
You know, Walter and Shirley, you know

17:27.500 --> 17:32.760
You know as you grew up, you know, maybe you're growing up wasn't as drastic as mine

17:34.500 --> 17:37.820
You know, I didn't handle it well me probably handle it the better than I did

17:37.980 --> 17:42.740
but you know, so how did that influence you know how you review Chinatown's now and

17:43.420 --> 17:45.420
And you know, what was it mean?

17:45.620 --> 17:48.140
You're growing up, even though you didn't grow up in a Chinatown

17:55.340 --> 17:57.340
Yeah, I grew up in DC

17:58.420 --> 18:03.740
Actually, we had a laundry in southeast near I guess over the bridge Pennsylvania Avenue

18:03.740 --> 18:11.420
And at that time in the schools I went to Elumentary and even Miller School. There weren't that many Asians

18:11.420 --> 18:13.420
So of course I was stood out

18:13.700 --> 18:17.380
There'll be like maybe one other girl who might be Chinese and then she moved away

18:17.380 --> 18:22.300
Not be only Asian person there and my friends were always to be amazed at the beginning of school year

18:22.300 --> 18:27.260
How teachers would always remember my name, but of course, you know, I was the only person who was Asian

18:27.260 --> 18:29.740
You know had black hair black eyes or whatever

18:30.140 --> 18:31.420
So I was

18:31.420 --> 18:36.380
I'm aware that I'm Chinese. I'm different from my Caucasian friends, even though

18:37.020 --> 18:39.360
They probably didn't look at me that way, which was good

18:39.720 --> 18:43.880
But I always knew that I was different, you know, my food was different at home

18:43.880 --> 18:48.240
I didn't eat sandwiches like they did. We always had rice at lunchtime

18:48.240 --> 18:54.920
You know, it was just different, you know, I had to stay in and we know we had a laundry and you know their parents

18:55.440 --> 19:03.360
Living a house and so my dream was someday that I was gonna have a house too and have and be like that dick and Jane book

19:03.480 --> 19:08.360
And have a dog and a cat and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay home

19:09.560 --> 19:11.240
anyway

19:11.240 --> 19:15.480
We do have a house so I did look be able to lift this American dream

19:15.560 --> 19:23.280
But yeah, I'm always aware that I'm Chinese and Chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to

19:23.320 --> 19:30.200
To meet their friends again, you know to talk to meet people of their same languages and that's that's always important for everybody

19:31.800 --> 19:39.040
Well, my background was entirely different. I I grew up in Texas actors born in San Antonio

19:39.400 --> 19:46.040
Were the major population Hispanic so there really weren't that many Chinese there and so it

19:46.840 --> 19:50.240
You know, we did what Chinese food we ate was was

19:51.040 --> 19:58.040
From my mother's cooking at home basically, you know, so we didn't have a Chinatown or anything like that

19:58.040 --> 20:02.920
We visit relatives for Chinese and so forth and that was about the extent of the Chinese population

20:03.640 --> 20:06.840
So when I came to Washington, DC to work in

20:07.840 --> 20:09.360
1972

20:09.360 --> 20:13.120
end up staying because I met my wife here, but I remember when I

20:14.160 --> 20:19.360
Visited New York City for the first time during Chinese New Year

20:19.360 --> 20:24.120
I was just so mesmerized by the number of Chinese

20:24.720 --> 20:32.560
In New York Chinatown, I mean to me it was so impressive to see so many Chinese

20:33.360 --> 20:35.240
There I

20:35.240 --> 20:42.560
Was thrilled to death really I I never experienced something like that. So it's great really it

20:43.560 --> 20:48.580
It's a it's a great thrill, you know to be among other Chinese and to see

20:48.720 --> 20:56.320
Go into a Chinatown where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth and they're all were so thriving really so

20:56.600 --> 21:02.080
it really was an eye-opening experience for me and it's something that

21:02.560 --> 21:10.080
I always will appreciate and even though the DC Chinatown is relatively small, but I think

21:11.080 --> 21:14.560
We both love it in terms of trying to we identify

21:15.760 --> 21:20.600
Sure, my wife Shirley and I you know, we're first generation. We're born here

21:20.600 --> 21:27.940
So we identify very much with what the immigrants are going through and so our church has a Chinatown service center

21:28.740 --> 21:34.900
That caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth. So we both are very very involved with that

21:35.340 --> 21:38.820
We have a program that where we tutor

21:39.820 --> 21:45.140
Immigrants with their English and help them with their citizenship. So for both of us has been very very rewarding

21:46.260 --> 21:52.540
So I mean so what what is the aura about Chinatown and makes Chinatown a Chinatown, you know as as

21:53.100 --> 21:55.260
So, you know, what is it?

21:56.100 --> 22:02.060
We're talking a lot of intangibles here. It seems like but a lot of real stuff too

22:02.060 --> 22:05.660
But but there are lots of intangibles. Would you say that read that Ted?

22:07.220 --> 22:09.220
Yeah, so

22:09.620 --> 22:14.380
So I hope that there is actually I hope that other people can contribute some ideas as well

22:14.500 --> 22:23.120
the idea of a Chinatown is where the what I remember one person one time somebody asked me he says that he says

22:25.500 --> 22:29.860
Why should we should we should we not preserve Chinatown?

22:30.180 --> 22:36.100
This is actually a Boston urban planner Chinatown urban planner and he says, you know, that's a bit

22:36.100 --> 22:37.940
That's a philosophical question

22:37.940 --> 22:44.900
If you ask me how do you preserve Chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and

22:45.180 --> 22:47.380
The constructions and the sites and so forth

22:47.380 --> 22:50.900
Well, that's a question I can answer as an engineer or a designer

22:51.060 --> 22:54.620
But if you ask me should we or should we not preserve Chinatown?

22:54.740 --> 23:01.300
Then that's a question of a lot philosophical question and I'm not sure all of us have the right answer to that

23:01.460 --> 23:06.900
Another person said to me that says Chinatown is where the Chinese people are if that's the case

23:07.100 --> 23:11.800
Then if you use the DC example, there are not that many Chinese residents

23:12.540 --> 23:20.220
Physically people living in Chinatown anymore many more are moving toward Rockville. Everybody knows that if you're talking about where the

23:21.060 --> 23:22.580
food is

23:22.580 --> 23:24.820
There are good Chinese restaurants in Chinatown

23:24.820 --> 23:30.700
There are others and even more than other places in Maryland in different places of this sort

23:30.700 --> 23:34.660
They in New York you talk about not just one Chinatown a Mott Street

23:34.660 --> 23:40.780
You talk about three or four Chinatowns because the different congregations of people and their restaurants have moved in

23:41.420 --> 23:47.140
Philadelphia the restaurants have moved and so forth and and so on so what is it that makes Chinatown

23:47.500 --> 23:49.940
Chinatown and where things are

23:50.380 --> 23:57.460
Think about it again right now. There are more Chinese festivals being done in the urban area. So you have these big festivals

23:58.220 --> 24:07.220
being done say at Tyson's Corner or Oak at one of the malls and they have these great dances all day long for Chinese New Year or for Qingming and

24:07.940 --> 24:14.700
You will go there and everybody will celebrate those things and learn a little bit eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about Chinese culture

24:14.700 --> 24:19.460
But you would never say that Tyson's Corner or Fair Oaks Mall is Chinatown

24:19.940 --> 24:24.660
Which you would never say that right but and you would have a hard time saying just because there's a

24:24.980 --> 24:31.780
Concentration of people in Rockville that Rockville is Chinatown. There's something about that term Chinatown

24:32.100 --> 24:37.900
In these historical Chinatowns that make makes it what it is and I'm not sure what it is. It's a yes

24:44.820 --> 24:46.820
Yes

24:46.820 --> 24:48.820
Yes

24:55.700 --> 24:58.100
Yes, so but at the same time

24:59.340 --> 25:01.940
So he is saying that how do you

25:02.860 --> 25:07.780
How how do you keep a Chinatown in the country as diverse as the United States is?

25:08.420 --> 25:10.420
That raises another interesting question

25:11.420 --> 25:17.900
Everybody else other ethnic groups have their own barrios their own fishermen's war for something this sort should all those

25:18.220 --> 25:21.060
Places be preserved separately as we grow

25:21.540 --> 25:26.860
We remember that I was raised and say a part of New York City

25:27.300 --> 25:32.940
But I don't necessarily want to maintain that area if I were raised in the projects in Detroit

25:33.300 --> 25:35.260
That's defined my character and stuff

25:35.260 --> 25:41.860
But I don't want this or preserve that that that that building right but why is it then that do we want to preserve a

25:42.340 --> 25:45.620
Chinatown area do we have any answers to that?

25:46.060 --> 25:48.060
Yeah, who has answers to that?

25:48.540 --> 25:50.740
You know my own my own answer

25:51.460 --> 25:55.140
Somewhat is I agree. I mean it is it's hard when to answer

25:55.140 --> 26:00.620
But you know I'm saying that you know what I what I read what I read earlier is that that Chinatown

26:01.020 --> 26:06.900
You know has his own deeply filled history and stories of national cultural significance

26:06.900 --> 26:11.440
And I think one of the things about Chinatown is it was a protective

26:11.860 --> 26:14.500
Area for us as opposed to you know

26:14.500 --> 26:20.100
this is where we had to be and I think you know there's lots of stories there that need to be preserved

26:20.260 --> 26:22.860
You know if not the structures of themselves

26:23.020 --> 26:27.900
Then the stories that go behind know why these China why were Chinatowns there?

26:27.900 --> 26:33.900
I think that's important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about you know why were these

26:34.660 --> 26:37.380
Why did that the the Chinese population?

26:37.660 --> 26:42.420
Retreat into these Chinatowns and and and they got the reputation

26:42.420 --> 26:44.780
It's not because that you know they wanted to per se

26:45.020 --> 26:49.700
But but then they were they were kind of forced into that area and they persevered there

26:49.700 --> 26:52.260
And I think that's how they became a stronger community

26:52.860 --> 26:57.020
It made for a sense of community and I think that that kind of history is there

26:57.060 --> 27:00.940
I don't know. I don't know if you disagree or not agree with me Walter or

27:02.260 --> 27:08.540
So you so part of the community is part of it is the community the current community there the historic community

27:08.540 --> 27:12.380
But part of it is sort of the Hollywood myth of Chinatown

27:12.700 --> 27:18.380
Who you know you have Chinatown movies you have everybody you talk about the for better or worse

27:18.820 --> 27:23.340
Whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this

27:23.740 --> 27:34.460
Chinatown evokes an image that I think other other I think communities don't necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for the Chinese Americans. Yeah

27:38.860 --> 27:40.860
Immersion and culture

27:53.340 --> 27:55.340
I think that's

28:11.740 --> 28:18.980
What why is that so one of the things she's saying is that growing up Oklahoma you come back much like

28:19.260 --> 28:23.820
Stan is saying or Walter is saying you come in and suddenly you surround it by

28:24.540 --> 28:30.580
Things that your parents or grandparents or that kind of stuff that happens and that gives you another sense of

28:30.740 --> 28:32.580
Part of your identity in history

28:32.580 --> 28:40.180
But why is that that you get that from a Chinatown and not from say going to the Chinese Historical Museum in New York or the

28:40.340 --> 28:44.620
Inju Island Museum and why is it that it's a Chinatown that does that that place?

28:45.340 --> 28:49.020
I think it's just an aura there that does that because I agree

28:49.500 --> 28:52.980
That what you're saying there because you know, I don't speak Chinese

28:52.980 --> 28:58.100
You know so you know people say they go to Chinese because they hear people speaking they're saying like I don't understand a word

28:58.100 --> 29:04.060
That's being said there by Chinese people there since so you know and I can say I ran away from my Chinese heritage

29:04.060 --> 29:10.460
So I really don't identify but somehow when I'm there, you know, I feel like hey staying your home

29:11.100 --> 29:15.580
And something is it you know, I use the term is a cultural touchstone for me

29:16.100 --> 29:22.580
In my personal journey and I think it I think that resonates with lots of people like me

29:22.900 --> 29:30.940
Who who've had us who've kind of run away from their identity or not sure what their identity is because the duality that we

29:31.820 --> 29:37.740
Chinese Americans face in this country, you know, you know living especially second generation people like us

29:38.740 --> 29:44.620
They're a generation fourth generation. Yeah. Yeah, I think for those who Chinese Americans who are born here

29:45.300 --> 29:49.740
You know, we may tend to view Chinatown more in the abstract as

29:51.740 --> 29:55.380
Something that has enduring meaning and I think it does

29:55.980 --> 29:58.460
Because it's it's a part of our history and so forth

29:58.660 --> 30:04.420
But I but I think there's another level which is much more basic and that is for the immigrants who come

30:04.860 --> 30:06.860
You know, they seek comfort

30:06.980 --> 30:14.700
in like kind language in other people who've had experiences just like them and so it

30:14.820 --> 30:18.140
To me, it's it's it's very very basic really

30:18.740 --> 30:25.820
It's security for immigrants who come and I think when you find someone who is sharing

30:26.380 --> 30:31.540
Somewhat the same experience that you're about to embark on it provides a tremendous

30:32.100 --> 30:34.100
Amount of comfort and security

30:34.220 --> 30:41.060
So in even in DC Chinatown when we look at it, we may find that it seemed to be relatively small

30:42.060 --> 30:46.380
But really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants

30:46.380 --> 30:48.540
I think it means so much to them

30:48.540 --> 30:54.620
And I think we see that in our interaction at the Chinatown service center the immigrants who come in for help

30:55.100 --> 30:59.980
Sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation to get something in the mail

30:59.980 --> 31:05.820
They don't know what this is so you can I think what we always try to do is put put ourselves in an immigrants place

31:06.620 --> 31:15.420
Imagine if you were to go to China and know not a word of Chinese and then how would you cope and so?

31:15.420 --> 31:18.380
I think that is the attitude that we take when we

31:19.380 --> 31:23.860
Assist immigrants who come to the Chinatown service center seeking help

31:29.980 --> 31:31.980
Sounds like

31:50.900 --> 31:52.940
That's that's a real toughy Kirk

31:53.180 --> 31:56.620
You know she's asking you know how do how do we you know I announced the question?

31:56.620 --> 32:01.300
I really want to present here as sort of our assignment you know how how do we do this?

32:01.300 --> 32:06.700
How how do we maintain because you're not gonna you're not you know DC Chinatown?

32:06.700 --> 32:09.060
It's not gonna have a lot of residents again

32:09.060 --> 32:14.940
You know and like like San Francisco where you're selling fish you know on the open market there and things like that and

32:14.940 --> 32:21.940
and a lot of people living there and speaking the language in Chinese and in dialects and so forth so

32:22.100 --> 32:29.400
That's a hard one to answer you know how do we preserve this this feeling here and preserve this most of all the history

32:29.400 --> 32:36.960
That's been there and and the and the people who live there play their life and cry there the whole thing

32:37.500 --> 32:39.300
so so

32:39.300 --> 32:46.900
So part part of it is you do have to maintain the physical appearance of the time that boundaries to define it whether it's the

32:47.620 --> 32:51.960
Architecture the little whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another question

32:52.020 --> 32:59.640
But there's something that allows it to be distinct so in DC Chinatown for example shops have to have Chinese characters on their windows

32:59.640 --> 33:02.800
Right and so those kind of things seem superficial

33:03.180 --> 33:09.780
But they are still important enough to help define that space then what you do in that space is important

33:09.780 --> 33:13.960
What are the activities that you do there do you allow the family?

33:14.200 --> 33:19.400
Associations to continue to operate there does the city given enough a family association

33:19.920 --> 33:26.040
Talking very much about the Lee association the more you're associated on long and things of these sorts these things

33:26.160 --> 33:30.120
Don't have the original purpose that they have in the sense that

33:30.840 --> 33:37.380
Everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke Chinese Chinese nights be English and they did a lot of extra or

33:37.760 --> 33:41.080
Judiciary or sort of semi judiciary type of functions

33:41.240 --> 33:47.400
But they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do Chinese

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
Consolidate benevolent association

33:50.920 --> 33:52.920
still represents 30 some odd

33:52.960 --> 33:54.240
associations of

33:54.240 --> 34:01.280
Chinese people and organizations they do annually the Chinese New Year parade those type of things are important still to do and

34:01.280 --> 34:06.200
We should have the city and continue to encourage that the building space does it have

34:07.000 --> 34:14.560
Places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which tan is talking about

34:14.600 --> 34:22.000
So if the people have or have gone there and lived there and have a story to tell and we ought to have a way to

34:22.200 --> 34:28.960
His preserve it and then to once we preserve it to tell it so that the next generation or other people

34:29.120 --> 34:31.120
Not just the next generation Chinese

34:31.120 --> 34:39.240
But other people who are passing through a giant town know that there are stories created in China town that represented the Chinese

34:40.360 --> 34:43.200
Identity or diaspora that happened to be in DC

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
You had another question

34:57.880 --> 34:59.880
Yes

35:01.120 --> 35:03.120
I

35:31.120 --> 35:33.120
I

35:35.880 --> 35:43.080
Correct and so one of the issues there that very much is on top of everybody's mind if you think about China town and what makes it

35:43.080 --> 35:50.920
It's the individual entrepreneurs the mom and pop shops the little things like that to sell the chashu bow and the all that kind of stuff

35:50.920 --> 35:56.520
Did you that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up?

35:56.520 --> 36:00.280
There's no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so forth like this

36:00.280 --> 36:07.360
And at a certain point those people that operate those businesses my mom and dad or somebody they're getting old and quite frankly

36:07.360 --> 36:09.400
They worked really hard to get you in college

36:09.400 --> 36:13.560
So you get that law degree right and you're not gonna go back there and run that place

36:13.760 --> 36:21.160
So those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things as us who have looking at property

36:22.160 --> 36:25.160
As the development China, how do we encourage?

36:26.440 --> 36:34.620
Something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed. It's already gone by right so

36:34.960 --> 36:38.560
So I'm not sure what the real answer is to that

36:39.040 --> 36:43.040
It could be city. Maybe the city has to produce some kind of

36:43.720 --> 36:48.160
Tax incentive that allows these things to stay but do you really want to do that?

36:48.160 --> 36:53.440
Do you really want to encourage a small business that doesn't that doesn't really make itself productive?

36:53.440 --> 36:57.320
Or do you have ordinance say there should be an Asian related Chinese?

36:57.320 --> 37:05.240
Those are all questions for us practically today my my feeling just to finish off is that I think I think what?

37:05.240 --> 37:11.160
We many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. I would like to see

37:12.040 --> 37:16.200
Big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there

37:16.360 --> 37:21.440
It allows us to do those things that make our Chinese life

37:22.080 --> 37:24.600
significant the wedding the

37:25.560 --> 37:27.080
the moon you

37:27.080 --> 37:31.560
The the Qingming Festival or something where you bring your family there

37:31.560 --> 37:37.440
You have to create so it's not so much that small definition of a shop

37:37.560 --> 37:44.360
But it is a Chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities

37:44.400 --> 37:49.340
Yeah, so well, yeah, we're almost at the end of our time. So we get closing comments here

37:53.200 --> 37:57.340
It is difficult to have small businesses. It's just not profitable

37:58.120 --> 38:03.600
It also I think housing is also a problem. That's why people cannot paint afford to live there

38:03.640 --> 38:06.400
We have all these expensive condominiums

38:07.960 --> 38:10.160
Unless you have a little a high income

38:10.320 --> 38:14.720
It seems impossible. So but we do have people who do want to live there

38:14.720 --> 38:20.760
They want to raise their families there and there's no affordable housing and low-income housing seem to be disappearing too

38:21.080 --> 38:26.000
So there's all sorts of problems and I really don't know really what can be done really

38:27.040 --> 38:31.280
Yeah, my fear is that what we're gonna end up having in DC

38:31.720 --> 38:38.440
Because of the gentrification and so forth is that what we end up having is just a commercial Chinatown

38:38.800 --> 38:41.360
Where we have very few residents

38:42.200 --> 38:47.200
Living there and that would be a real shame really, you know, we I think in Las Vegas

38:47.200 --> 38:49.320
They have what they call a Chinatown in a mall

38:49.880 --> 38:55.480
To me that is not a Chinatown really and I think it's incumbent upon the city to

38:55.840 --> 39:02.680
Provide affordable housing right now. There's three buildings that are affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping block

39:03.160 --> 39:08.440
Because because it's such a hot area. They want to turn that into a condominium

39:08.640 --> 39:16.640
So I don't know what the answer is basically but I think at the very least what we know we need is an infusion of capital with

39:17.640 --> 39:22.000
Because you know, we have to put traffic in the air the area is is really a hot area now

39:22.080 --> 39:28.480
But we need some entrepreneurs with some Chinese connections who's willing to invest in the area right now

39:28.480 --> 39:34.640
We have we have this is like Panera Starbucks. They're all coming in but the Chinese entrepreneurs

39:34.640 --> 39:36.640
I think are unwilling to make the investment

39:37.200 --> 39:42.340
Okay, very good. Yeah, I think I agree with all that and you know that the one point that I did want to

39:42.800 --> 39:47.280
Emphasize on yours that you know, we I certainly don't want it to be a commercial Chinatown

39:47.520 --> 39:52.360
Yeah, I don't want to we don't know none of us want a Disneyland atmosphere there

39:52.360 --> 39:59.600
We're just for tourists to come in there and gawk at the Chinese people there and that's not that's not a Chinatown

39:59.920 --> 40:07.000
You know, we want it to be meaningful. I think what they're saying is right. We're gonna have to help help from the city planners

40:07.520 --> 40:13.160
To bring in the right businesses and and to make the right conditions there to make it work

40:14.160 --> 40:18.200
Excuse me, but so so we're coming to the end here

40:18.200 --> 40:24.400
So again, I want I want to read again from from this quote here because I think it's very significant that what what what?

40:24.400 --> 40:30.640
Bonnie Suey says in this book here says, you know, the myth of America lies in its patchwork heritage

40:31.400 --> 40:38.080
Though the United States hasn't always tolerated difference it continues to this day to be built by immigrants

40:38.400 --> 40:46.600
The cut this contradiction is in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening the birth of cultural pride that is still evolving

40:47.720 --> 40:55.140
Visitors in Chinatown have a role. You all have a role just as residents do in the bartering of cultural currency

40:55.360 --> 40:58.320
If there's authenticity to be experienced

40:58.720 --> 41:05.640
It's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. It's a reminder of what makes America special and

41:06.000 --> 41:09.760
And so after a century and a half of Chinese immigration

41:10.560 --> 41:18.520
Chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into America and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese heritage

41:18.880 --> 41:22.080
And so I thank you all for your attention today

41:22.080 --> 41:28.040
And I think Ted Walter and and Shirley for their participation here

41:28.040 --> 41:32.600
And really I said you guys got a year of silence then you help us out help us with Chinatowns

41:32.920 --> 41:37.880
You know make it make it work for us here. We're make it work for you, too. Thank you

41:47.920 --> 41:51.680
Don't go too far away because starting in just a few minutes we'll have another

41:52.240 --> 41:57.080
Panel discussion this one entitled young historians living histories

41:57.480 --> 42:02.220
So starting in just a few minutes as we get set up young historians living histories

42:02.800 --> 42:04.800
Yeah

42:05.080 --> 42:07.080
Yeah, no

42:08.120 --> 42:12.280
