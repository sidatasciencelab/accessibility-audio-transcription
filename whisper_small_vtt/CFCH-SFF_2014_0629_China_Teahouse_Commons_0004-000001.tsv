0	6320	Hello, hello everyone. We're getting set up for our next session in tea house comments. You are in the
7040	10880	China program of the 2014 Smithsonian Folklife Festival
10960	18640	This program is presented through a collaboration by the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian with the China
19040	21040	International Culture Association
21200	26600	Working with the China Arts and Entertainment Group in Beijing. Thanks a lot for being here today
26600	33080	I don't know if you've noticed but we're doing programs slightly different today the China Festival program actually brought over
33600	39600	120 artists and presenters from China to participate in this program, but today we're doing something a little bit different
39600	41360	We're calling it diaspora day
41360	45880	There are about four million people of Chinese ancestry in the United States and today
45880	53080	We're celebrating the way in which when people move how they transform and adapt culture community and traditions to the new
53080	59280	Police places where they end up so today this this session that we're going into right now is one of the programs that is a part of the
59280	64640	diaspora day programming which is also co-produced with the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center
65080	73600	So we have today's session right now that you're we're getting ready to start is the 1882 foundation talk story on the mall
73600	77400	And we are going to be talking about China town today
77720	80220	China town today is the subject of this session
80220	86800	And I'm going to go ahead and introduce to Stan Lu who is going to do the presenting and the moderating of this session
86880	89720	With our with our experts here today our local experts
89720	95920	And I want to first introduce you to Stan so that you know a little bit about him and a little bit about the 1882 foundation
96600	101840	So Stan Lu sitting right here to my left is a retired civil engineer
101840	107920	He used to work for the Federal Aviation Administration and he went to China for the first time in 2003
108920	111640	2003 he spent two years two years there's
111920	118480	Teaching Chinese at a university and when he came back to the US he became very interested and committed to working with Chinese American
118680	121680	Organizations Stan is himself a native of Greenville, Mississippi
122600	125780	Which you will soon hear very clearly when he takes the mic
126720	131320	But Stan has been very involved in a lot of organizations including the organization of Chinese American
132120	138360	as well as the 1882 foundation and for those of you who don't know the 1882 foundation is a
139240	140760	nonpartisan non-profit
140760	146360	national network of people who are working to educate lawmakers and the public about the
146800	149520	historical impact of Chinese exclusion laws and
150280	151320	1882
151320	158240	specifically refers to the date of the first of these exclusion laws which were designed to basically keep Chinese immigrants out of the United States and to prevent
158240	161200	Those who were here already from ever obtaining citizenship
161320	163880	So they've been doing really wonderful work around the country
164240	169640	And I'm now going to turn it over to Stan to get this session going and introduce the rest of the panel. Okay. Thank you
169640	175560	So Jin hey, it's pleasure for us to be here on the mall doing our talk story on the mall and
176320	183280	We and this is diaspora day like so Jin was saying here and I'm gonna introduce everybody here
183280	184480	Are we gonna?
184480	190080	We're gonna have a conversation and you'll get to know who we are because I don't want to spend a whole lot of time going over
190280	194760	Credentials that it really don't matter, you know, what we say is what's gonna be important
194880	199400	So so this is diaspora day and you know and you know the epitome of
199920	207080	Diasporos in the United States of course are China towns and that's that's what we think about when when talking about the display
207080	210160	The Chinese who are away from China in the United States
210160	215520	They're China towns is the first thing to come to my mind and so, you know when we put out our flyer
215960	220480	You know we said that you know that we're gonna talk about China town today
220480	224840	And but this is not gonna be a travel log by any means, you know
224840	227560	we want to talk about what China town means to us and
228840	236780	Because like we said in the flyer China town has different meanings to different people and one of the references I have this book called
238120	242080	American China towns written by Bonnie Suey and so I'll just
243080	250480	Read briefly what she says about you know China town USA a state of mind a world within a world a
250960	253680	Neighborhood that exists in more cities than you might imagine
254520	256520	every day
256960	259720	Americans find something different in China town
260400	266600	It's a place is foreign yet familiar by now quite well known on the Western cultural radar
266800	274600	But splitting the difference still gives many visitors to China town the sense above all that things are not
275880	277880	what they seem and
278360	280880	Popular culture has been telling us this for decades
280880	285880	And it's true that few visitors realize just how much goes on
286400	292960	Beneath the surface of the vibrant microcosm a place with its own deeply felt history and
293560	300920	Stories of national cultural significance, so you know our panel today is going to talk about you know what this means to
301680	310560	To the APA community Chinese American community from our from our viewpoint and then we don't we won't agree on everything because you know as you as
310560	312240	those of you who are
312240	316280	Chinese Americans or Chinese know that you know there's very
316960	321760	We argue a lot, so we have differences of opinion about what China town means to us
322120	325640	And we have and certainly the three panelists here
326160	330960	We all have our own opinions about it and but one thing that you know
330960	333680	And also what you in the audience to be thinking about it to you
333680	337800	What does China town mean to you and you know that's going to be your takeaway for today
338160	344360	Is come out of this this session here real thinking about what China town means when you go
344360	348560	But when if you're here in the DC area go to DC China town and see you know
348560	353280	What does it mean to you and you know and because it's changing every day
353680	360040	China towns and so our lowest you from out of town go back to your hometowns and and look at the China towns there
360040	364600	And what does it mean to you? So that's that's your assignment from coming from the day
364800	373000	But so our our group here one thing we have in common. I think is is that we we all are all ABCs
373720	379520	That's American born Chinese. So, you know, we have that perspective that that we aren't
380840	384360	We're born in this country. So we are Americans, but we're awesome
384360	386480	But we're really definitely Chinese Americans
386480	393360	We're all active in in the DC China town and we do participate in our talk story events that we have in China town
393600	400000	Every month where we gather the community together to share stories of our experiences as
400600	405800	Growing up as Chinese Americans Asian Americans, you know and what that means and you know
405800	412120	We have this monthly in in China town and so if you want if you're interested in if you're in the area, you know
412760	417240	Talk to us afterwards and we'll get you on our mailing list and let you know when the next events are gonna be
417280	419280	But for today, it's China town
419960	423560	It's it's talk story on the mall and so I'm gonna
424080	429840	The way we're gonna introduce each ourselves is I'm gonna go down here and and ask the question
430320	431760	you know
431760	434280	What does China town mean to you and
435440	438920	How is it important to you and then you tell us who you are?
438920	445920	You know what your relationship is and then and then tell us you want to start surely who
446960	451720	Is is involved so tell us about who you are and then what and answer the questions
451720	453720	You didn't do it. Okay
455160	457160	Yeah, my name is Shirley will
457840	464560	Actually, I was born in Washington DC and my involvement in China town is because I'm the director of the China town service center
464680	466800	Which is part of the Chinese community church
467160	472640	The only Chinese community church in Washington DC we like to say and actually the reason I'm here is because
473440	474880	another lady
474880	480000	Was unable to make it and she really was born and worked in China town for many years
480000	484160	And she had one of the first stores in China town that's doing in existence today
484880	492200	Anyway, I'm here to be part of this panel and they tell you that China town is very meaningful to me even though
492200	497840	I was born in DC and then my parents used to come to China town when we were quite young and
498280	502000	At that time it was a lot different. It was a lot smaller a lot quieter
502000	509000	And it was a way for people to meet people like themselves to speak their languages to have a cup of tea
509360	512320	To go over old news about what was happening in China
512600	518000	What was going on in America and I think it's important to me because it is a community even though
518200	520760	We think of it as maybe just a place
521240	523600	People come to eat or it's a touristy place
523920	528520	But there are real residents that live there and it's important. I think to maintain that
531880	535320	My name is Walter Wu. I'm Shirley's husband
535840	537840	and I also
538240	543440	Help at the Chinatown service center, which is a part of the Chinese Community Church
543440	546720	Which is located in the heart of Chinatown. This is that's where we worship
547720	554880	I am an ABC and American born Chinese. I was born in Texas a transplant here in 1972
554880	561640	And in San Antonio, we didn't have a Chinatown and I think for that reason I have a
562160	568680	Special appreciation if not a greater appreciation of Chinatown even though the one in DC
568680	575840	It's quite small as compared let's say to the ones in New York or San Francisco or Los Angeles
576800	582120	We tutor immigrants with their help them improve their English on Saturday morning
582120	588120	We have a program and we also help them with their citizenship and we know how valuable that the
588600	591320	Residents of fine living in Chinatown is
591960	595720	You know we you may go to Chinatown and it may have shrunk
596080	599840	In terms of the commercial Chinatown in terms of the number of restaurants
600000	605580	But I think you will see you find a significant number of Chinese that live there
605580	610080	They they live in mainly in three public housing projects
610600	612600	Located not that far from the heart of Chinatown
613840	616560	So I think the when we help
617280	622940	Not just ourselves, but we have other two have one of our tutors actually who's here who's been a longtime tutor
623320	628960	At our Saturday program and I think the reward that we get is that when we help
629520	634520	Immigrants improve their English or help them in some way we can see the smile on their face
634520	640280	We can see the appreciation and we can see the gratitude that they have and Chinatown
640440	645600	What it is it's it provides an instant a community for the Chinese to
646560	650600	Fellowship with other Chinese and with similar language
650600	656060	So it's really a very key part in helping assimilate into this country
658160	660400	So my name is Ted Gong I'm
661600	667200	I'm from California and everybody's using these terms ABC and I'm ABC and
667640	672520	American-born Chinese but as you guys all know probably there's always like HIP
672960	674800	Hong Kong instant product
674920	678000	MIT made in Taiwan all that kind of stuff like this, but
679000	684520	ABC and when I I'm about a fourth or fifth generation Chinese from California from Fresno
684520	687040	Anybody from Fresno anybody know Fresno?
691040	695600	Fresno and we of course didn't have a Chinatown there and the Chinatown that we
696040	698100	always go to is either San Francisco
699120	701520	primarily or to Los Angeles and
701800	710040	You know the thing about growing up in the rural California is I think there's probably like one or two other Chinese families in my town
711440	714440	Mostly we pick I was just talking with somebody about picking
715720	720120	Cotton you know the long cotton bags and you drag the cotton bags and do things like this
720120	726160	But you would always my mom and dad ran a grocery store in in a little tiny grocery store in
726440	734760	Rosie, California near Dainuba, California, which is there Fresno, but we would always have these things where mom and dad would always say we've got to go to
736040	738880	Daifu Daifu San Francisco Chinatown
738880	747920	You have to go back to buy the groceries to get to talk to the to the family folk to have the banquets to have the weddings and so
747920	753360	For so Chinatown has that meaning as well. It is a place in which you rejuvenate
753800	758560	In many levels one to get the groceries that you can't get in rural, California
759240	762760	to get the food or the banquet that familiar taste to
763440	769000	Talk with those relatives to have those banquets and those meals and so forth Chinatown
770520	773300	Historically and this DC China has had that same
774640	776400	Purpose has
776480	780280	Changed over originally a place for immigrants to come
780720	785880	Still is a place for immigrants to come to get the skills the language get used to
787120	791720	the America America so that they can go off and do better things in
793120	800960	Before Chinatown has other purposes during the exclusion acts we talk about the 1882 exclusion act Chinatown's are actually a protective place
801560	803560	You know in
804480	806480	8200 and so forth if you
806960	808960	were Chinese in
809800	817320	Rural part of California during the time when the Chinese exclusion acts was going on the explosion period you could be killed
817560	820840	You know and Chinatown was a protective enclave
821280	826920	That is the place where Chinatown's gather together protect themselves in California just to let you know
827920	833940	After the exclusion acts and the period which they call the Expulsion period
834240	838960	There were officially 200 roundups of Chinese rural Chinese
839320	845120	Kick out of the areas or killed or lynched and forced out of their rural towns to purge
845640	848680	Chinese from the districts and Chinatown function as a place a
849240	856560	Protective place later on it becomes a place where immigrants get skills later on it becomes a place where people are
856920	861240	able to move from there to other parts of the community like in DC here
862160	869120	The original DC Chinatown here does anybody know where the original DC Chinatown was is a federal triangle
869480	874980	The original Chinatown was a federal triangle and it's expect it was then pushed off to where it is now
874980	878720	And it's now constricted to where it is so it continues to evolve
879000	884080	But there is something about Chinatown that is different. There is a sense that Chinatown
884680	890920	Is a place where you can get identity it's linked with Chinese American identity. It's linked with our
891640	895360	Culture it's linked with a desire to go back like myself
895960	900040	To find those things which make up our culture and our identity
900360	904720	Chinatown can be a concept as well as a place very good very good
904720	909360	So yeah, I think all all three of you what you said is you know, right on
909480	911000	It's it's different
911000	913920	There's different views of what Chinatown is and again
913920	918080	I'm gonna quote from this book here because I think it has some great quotes in it here
918080	921320	The truth is that Chinatown is a space of self-invention
922080	928640	The oldest Chinese immigrants including but not limited to those who landed in the port cities of New York San Francisco
928960	935400	Los Angeles Honolulu had to create a community setting that was palatable to the white society at large
935960	943640	These days new immigrants continue to come for a new life and a search for and a search for a cultural identity
944520	949700	Brings Chinese Americans of many generations back to walk alongside them
949700	956560	And I guess you know I kind of fall in that latter category about looking for myself identity because you know
956560	961620	What Chinatown means to me is you know, I feel good there for some reason, you know
961620	967460	I can't explain it because you know my upbringing was was such that I
967980	974620	Grew up in Mississippi like so Jen said during the 40s and 50s during extremely a bad time there
974620	980100	Where I was just not fun being Chinese, you know, we were picked on we were abused
980540	984180	And we couldn't go to schools with anybody else
984180	988380	We had to build a one-room schoolhouse for us where we had all of our
989260	996020	All the families in the city of Greenville in one school house and house all 12 grades with one teacher
996540	1002820	So, you know for that was kind of life. I was brought up with and so I said, hey, it's no fun being Chinese
1002820	1004820	I'm not gonna be Chinese. So I
1004820	1012100	You know, I literally rejected my heritage ran away from it, you know, try to forget who I was and and so
1012500	1018340	My long journey back so I'm on a journey of self-discovery now because I think I've come back
1018460	1024460	You know, I'm proud to be Chinese American now and it's part of and Chinatown's a part of my
1024820	1030460	Help me in finding myself identity and that and that's I think that's a very key part of
1030980	1038460	What why we're espousing what the importance of Chinatown's here for me because there's a personal journey
1038460	1044300	I think it's a personal journey for all of us here in the community and so, you know, I would like to ask
1044580	1046580	You know, Walter and Shirley, you know
1047500	1052760	You know as you grew up, you know, maybe you're growing up wasn't as drastic as mine
1054500	1057820	You know, I didn't handle it well me probably handle it the better than I did
1057980	1062740	but you know, so how did that influence you know how you review Chinatown's now and
1063420	1065420	And you know, what was it mean?
1065620	1068140	You're growing up, even though you didn't grow up in a Chinatown
1075340	1077340	Yeah, I grew up in DC
1078420	1083740	Actually, we had a laundry in southeast near I guess over the bridge Pennsylvania Avenue
1083740	1091420	And at that time in the schools I went to Elumentary and even Miller School. There weren't that many Asians
1091420	1093420	So of course I was stood out
1093700	1097380	There'll be like maybe one other girl who might be Chinese and then she moved away
1097380	1102300	Not be only Asian person there and my friends were always to be amazed at the beginning of school year
1102300	1107260	How teachers would always remember my name, but of course, you know, I was the only person who was Asian
1107260	1109740	You know had black hair black eyes or whatever
1110140	1111420	So I was
1111420	1116380	I'm aware that I'm Chinese. I'm different from my Caucasian friends, even though
1117020	1119360	They probably didn't look at me that way, which was good
1119720	1123880	But I always knew that I was different, you know, my food was different at home
1123880	1128240	I didn't eat sandwiches like they did. We always had rice at lunchtime
1128240	1134920	You know, it was just different, you know, I had to stay in and we know we had a laundry and you know their parents
1135440	1143360	Living a house and so my dream was someday that I was gonna have a house too and have and be like that dick and Jane book
1143480	1148360	And have a dog and a cat and daddy would go to work and mommy would stay home
1149560	1151240	anyway
1151240	1155480	We do have a house so I did look be able to lift this American dream
1155560	1163280	But yeah, I'm always aware that I'm Chinese and Chinatown was important to have a place to go to so that my parents go to
1163320	1170200	To meet their friends again, you know to talk to meet people of their same languages and that's that's always important for everybody
1171800	1179040	Well, my background was entirely different. I I grew up in Texas actors born in San Antonio
1179400	1186040	Were the major population Hispanic so there really weren't that many Chinese there and so it
1186840	1190240	You know, we did what Chinese food we ate was was
1191040	1198040	From my mother's cooking at home basically, you know, so we didn't have a Chinatown or anything like that
1198040	1202920	We visit relatives for Chinese and so forth and that was about the extent of the Chinese population
1203640	1206840	So when I came to Washington, DC to work in
1207840	1209360	1972
1209360	1213120	end up staying because I met my wife here, but I remember when I
1214160	1219360	Visited New York City for the first time during Chinese New Year
1219360	1224120	I was just so mesmerized by the number of Chinese
1224720	1232560	In New York Chinatown, I mean to me it was so impressive to see so many Chinese
1233360	1235240	There I
1235240	1242560	Was thrilled to death really I I never experienced something like that. So it's great really it
1243560	1248580	It's a it's a great thrill, you know to be among other Chinese and to see
1248720	1256320	Go into a Chinatown where you see so many restaurants and so many businesses and so forth and they're all were so thriving really so
1256600	1262080	it really was an eye-opening experience for me and it's something that
1262560	1270080	I always will appreciate and even though the DC Chinatown is relatively small, but I think
1271080	1274560	We both love it in terms of trying to we identify
1275760	1280600	Sure, my wife Shirley and I you know, we're first generation. We're born here
1280600	1287940	So we identify very much with what the immigrants are going through and so our church has a Chinatown service center
1288740	1294900	That caters to immigrants and helps them with their social needs and so forth. So we both are very very involved with that
1295340	1298820	We have a program that where we tutor
1299820	1305140	Immigrants with their English and help them with their citizenship. So for both of us has been very very rewarding
1306260	1312540	So I mean so what what is the aura about Chinatown and makes Chinatown a Chinatown, you know as as
1313100	1315260	So, you know, what is it?
1316100	1322060	We're talking a lot of intangibles here. It seems like but a lot of real stuff too
1322060	1325660	But but there are lots of intangibles. Would you say that read that Ted?
1327220	1329220	Yeah, so
1329620	1334380	So I hope that there is actually I hope that other people can contribute some ideas as well
1334500	1343120	the idea of a Chinatown is where the what I remember one person one time somebody asked me he says that he says
1345500	1349860	Why should we should we should we not preserve Chinatown?
1350180	1356100	This is actually a Boston urban planner Chinatown urban planner and he says, you know, that's a bit
1356100	1357940	That's a philosophical question
1357940	1364900	If you ask me how do you preserve Chinatown in terms of how do you do the traffic flows and how do you do the buildings and
1365180	1367380	The constructions and the sites and so forth
1367380	1370900	Well, that's a question I can answer as an engineer or a designer
1371060	1374620	But if you ask me should we or should we not preserve Chinatown?
1374740	1381300	Then that's a question of a lot philosophical question and I'm not sure all of us have the right answer to that
1381460	1386900	Another person said to me that says Chinatown is where the Chinese people are if that's the case
1387100	1391800	Then if you use the DC example, there are not that many Chinese residents
1392540	1400220	Physically people living in Chinatown anymore many more are moving toward Rockville. Everybody knows that if you're talking about where the
1401060	1402580	food is
1402580	1404820	There are good Chinese restaurants in Chinatown
1404820	1410700	There are others and even more than other places in Maryland in different places of this sort
1410700	1414660	They in New York you talk about not just one Chinatown a Mott Street
1414660	1420780	You talk about three or four Chinatowns because the different congregations of people and their restaurants have moved in
1421420	1427140	Philadelphia the restaurants have moved and so forth and and so on so what is it that makes Chinatown
1427500	1429940	Chinatown and where things are
1430380	1437460	Think about it again right now. There are more Chinese festivals being done in the urban area. So you have these big festivals
1438220	1447220	being done say at Tyson's Corner or Oak at one of the malls and they have these great dances all day long for Chinese New Year or for Qingming and
1447940	1454700	You will go there and everybody will celebrate those things and learn a little bit eat a little bit and learn a little bit more about Chinese culture
1454700	1459460	But you would never say that Tyson's Corner or Fair Oaks Mall is Chinatown
1459940	1464660	Which you would never say that right but and you would have a hard time saying just because there's a
1464980	1471780	Concentration of people in Rockville that Rockville is Chinatown. There's something about that term Chinatown
1472100	1477900	In these historical Chinatowns that make makes it what it is and I'm not sure what it is. It's a yes
1484820	1486820	Yes
1486820	1488820	Yes
1495700	1498100	Yes, so but at the same time
1499340	1501940	So he is saying that how do you
1502860	1507780	How how do you keep a Chinatown in the country as diverse as the United States is?
1508420	1510420	That raises another interesting question
1511420	1517900	Everybody else other ethnic groups have their own barrios their own fishermen's war for something this sort should all those
1518220	1521060	Places be preserved separately as we grow
1521540	1526860	We remember that I was raised and say a part of New York City
1527300	1532940	But I don't necessarily want to maintain that area if I were raised in the projects in Detroit
1533300	1535260	That's defined my character and stuff
1535260	1541860	But I don't want this or preserve that that that that building right but why is it then that do we want to preserve a
1542340	1545620	Chinatown area do we have any answers to that?
1546060	1548060	Yeah, who has answers to that?
1548540	1550740	You know my own my own answer
1551460	1555140	Somewhat is I agree. I mean it is it's hard when to answer
1555140	1560620	But you know I'm saying that you know what I what I read what I read earlier is that that Chinatown
1561020	1566900	You know has his own deeply filled history and stories of national cultural significance
1566900	1571440	And I think one of the things about Chinatown is it was a protective
1571860	1574500	Area for us as opposed to you know
1574500	1580100	this is where we had to be and I think you know there's lots of stories there that need to be preserved
1580260	1582860	You know if not the structures of themselves
1583020	1587900	Then the stories that go behind know why these China why were Chinatowns there?
1587900	1593900	I think that's important history lesson for all of us in this country to know about you know why were these
1594660	1597380	Why did that the the Chinese population?
1597660	1602420	Retreat into these Chinatowns and and and they got the reputation
1602420	1604780	It's not because that you know they wanted to per se
1605020	1609700	But but then they were they were kind of forced into that area and they persevered there
1609700	1612260	And I think that's how they became a stronger community
1612860	1617020	It made for a sense of community and I think that that kind of history is there
1617060	1620940	I don't know. I don't know if you disagree or not agree with me Walter or
1622260	1628540	So you so part of the community is part of it is the community the current community there the historic community
1628540	1632380	But part of it is sort of the Hollywood myth of Chinatown
1632700	1638380	Who you know you have Chinatown movies you have everybody you talk about the for better or worse
1638820	1643340	Whether it's the stereotype of the underground tongs or the other stuff like this
1643740	1654460	Chinatown evokes an image that I think other other I think communities don't necessarily evoke and it's both positive and negative for the Chinese Americans. Yeah
1658860	1660860	Immersion and culture
1673340	1675340	I think that's
1691740	1698980	What why is that so one of the things she's saying is that growing up Oklahoma you come back much like
1699260	1703820	Stan is saying or Walter is saying you come in and suddenly you surround it by
1704540	1710580	Things that your parents or grandparents or that kind of stuff that happens and that gives you another sense of
1710740	1712580	Part of your identity in history
1712580	1720180	But why is that that you get that from a Chinatown and not from say going to the Chinese Historical Museum in New York or the
1720340	1724620	Inju Island Museum and why is it that it's a Chinatown that does that that place?
1725340	1729020	I think it's just an aura there that does that because I agree
1729500	1732980	That what you're saying there because you know, I don't speak Chinese
1732980	1738100	You know so you know people say they go to Chinese because they hear people speaking they're saying like I don't understand a word
1738100	1744060	That's being said there by Chinese people there since so you know and I can say I ran away from my Chinese heritage
1744060	1750460	So I really don't identify but somehow when I'm there, you know, I feel like hey staying your home
1751100	1755580	And something is it you know, I use the term is a cultural touchstone for me
1756100	1762580	In my personal journey and I think it I think that resonates with lots of people like me
1762900	1770940	Who who've had us who've kind of run away from their identity or not sure what their identity is because the duality that we
1771820	1777740	Chinese Americans face in this country, you know, you know living especially second generation people like us
1778740	1784620	They're a generation fourth generation. Yeah. Yeah, I think for those who Chinese Americans who are born here
1785300	1789740	You know, we may tend to view Chinatown more in the abstract as
1791740	1795380	Something that has enduring meaning and I think it does
1795980	1798460	Because it's it's a part of our history and so forth
1798660	1804420	But I but I think there's another level which is much more basic and that is for the immigrants who come
1804860	1806860	You know, they seek comfort
1806980	1814700	in like kind language in other people who've had experiences just like them and so it
1814820	1818140	To me, it's it's it's very very basic really
1818740	1825820	It's security for immigrants who come and I think when you find someone who is sharing
1826380	1831540	Somewhat the same experience that you're about to embark on it provides a tremendous
1832100	1834100	Amount of comfort and security
1834220	1841060	So in even in DC Chinatown when we look at it, we may find that it seemed to be relatively small
1842060	1846380	But really for the people who live there the newly arrived immigrants
1846380	1848540	I think it means so much to them
1848540	1854620	And I think we see that in our interaction at the Chinatown service center the immigrants who come in for help
1855100	1859980	Sometimes they just something very very simple they come in just for translation to get something in the mail
1859980	1865820	They don't know what this is so you can I think what we always try to do is put put ourselves in an immigrants place
1866620	1875420	Imagine if you were to go to China and know not a word of Chinese and then how would you cope and so?
1875420	1878380	I think that is the attitude that we take when we
1879380	1883860	Assist immigrants who come to the Chinatown service center seeking help
1889980	1891980	Sounds like
1910900	1912940	That's that's a real toughy Kirk
1913180	1916620	You know she's asking you know how do how do we you know I announced the question?
1916620	1921300	I really want to present here as sort of our assignment you know how how do we do this?
1921300	1926700	How how do we maintain because you're not gonna you're not you know DC Chinatown?
1926700	1929060	It's not gonna have a lot of residents again
1929060	1934940	You know and like like San Francisco where you're selling fish you know on the open market there and things like that and
1934940	1941940	and a lot of people living there and speaking the language in Chinese and in dialects and so forth so
1942100	1949400	That's a hard one to answer you know how do we preserve this this feeling here and preserve this most of all the history
1949400	1956960	That's been there and and the and the people who live there play their life and cry there the whole thing
1957500	1959300	so so
1959300	1966900	So part part of it is you do have to maintain the physical appearance of the time that boundaries to define it whether it's the
1967620	1971960	Architecture the little whether or not they're bona fide architecture is another question
1972020	1979640	But there's something that allows it to be distinct so in DC Chinatown for example shops have to have Chinese characters on their windows
1979640	1982800	Right and so those kind of things seem superficial
1983180	1989780	But they are still important enough to help define that space then what you do in that space is important
1989780	1993960	What are the activities that you do there do you allow the family?
1994200	1999400	Associations to continue to operate there does the city given enough a family association
1999920	2006040	Talking very much about the Lee association the more you're associated on long and things of these sorts these things
2006160	2010120	Don't have the original purpose that they have in the sense that
2010840	2017380	Everybody had to go through them because nobody else spoke Chinese Chinese nights be English and they did a lot of extra or
2017760	2021080	Judiciary or sort of semi judiciary type of functions
2021240	2027400	But they are still important because they are gathering places to help the person identify what they do Chinese
2028600	2030600	Consolidate benevolent association
2030920	2032920	still represents 30 some odd
2032960	2034240	associations of
2034240	2041280	Chinese people and organizations they do annually the Chinese New Year parade those type of things are important still to do and
2041280	2046200	We should have the city and continue to encourage that the building space does it have
2047000	2054560	Places that are museums that allow us to preserve and tell the stories which tan is talking about
2054600	2062000	So if the people have or have gone there and lived there and have a story to tell and we ought to have a way to
2062200	2068960	His preserve it and then to once we preserve it to tell it so that the next generation or other people
2069120	2071120	Not just the next generation Chinese
2071120	2079240	But other people who are passing through a giant town know that there are stories created in China town that represented the Chinese
2080360	2083200	Identity or diaspora that happened to be in DC
2084600	2086600	You had another question
2097880	2099880	Yes
2101120	2103120	I
2131120	2133120	I
2135880	2143080	Correct and so one of the issues there that very much is on top of everybody's mind if you think about China town and what makes it
2143080	2150920	It's the individual entrepreneurs the mom and pop shops the little things like that to sell the chashu bow and the all that kind of stuff
2150920	2156520	Did you that we think of as comfort food as you gentrify the prices go up?
2156520	2160280	There's no way to stop the city from raising the taxes and so forth like this
2160280	2167360	And at a certain point those people that operate those businesses my mom and dad or somebody they're getting old and quite frankly
2167360	2169400	They worked really hard to get you in college
2169400	2173560	So you get that law degree right and you're not gonna go back there and run that place
2173760	2181160	So those are very real practical questions to look at and some of the things as us who have looking at property
2182160	2185160	As the development China, how do we encourage?
2186440	2194620	Something like that there recognizing that economically we may have already passed. It's already gone by right so
2194960	2198560	So I'm not sure what the real answer is to that
2199040	2203040	It could be city. Maybe the city has to produce some kind of
2203720	2208160	Tax incentive that allows these things to stay but do you really want to do that?
2208160	2213440	Do you really want to encourage a small business that doesn't that doesn't really make itself productive?
2213440	2217320	Or do you have ordinance say there should be an Asian related Chinese?
2217320	2225240	Those are all questions for us practically today my my feeling just to finish off is that I think I think what?
2225240	2231160	We many people focus on the small shops because we like the mom and pop. I would like to see
2232040	2236200	Big banquet facilities because if you have a banquet there
2236360	2241440	It allows us to do those things that make our Chinese life
2242080	2244600	significant the wedding the
2245560	2247080	the moon you
2247080	2251560	The the Qingming Festival or something where you bring your family there
2251560	2257440	You have to create so it's not so much that small definition of a shop
2257560	2264360	But it is a Chinese sort of setting that allows you to carry on your family traditions and your activities
2264400	2269340	Yeah, so well, yeah, we're almost at the end of our time. So we get closing comments here
2273200	2277340	It is difficult to have small businesses. It's just not profitable
2278120	2283600	It also I think housing is also a problem. That's why people cannot paint afford to live there
2283640	2286400	We have all these expensive condominiums
2287960	2290160	Unless you have a little a high income
2290320	2294720	It seems impossible. So but we do have people who do want to live there
2294720	2300760	They want to raise their families there and there's no affordable housing and low-income housing seem to be disappearing too
2301080	2306000	So there's all sorts of problems and I really don't know really what can be done really
2307040	2311280	Yeah, my fear is that what we're gonna end up having in DC
2311720	2318440	Because of the gentrification and so forth is that what we end up having is just a commercial Chinatown
2318800	2321360	Where we have very few residents
2322200	2327200	Living there and that would be a real shame really, you know, we I think in Las Vegas
2327200	2329320	They have what they call a Chinatown in a mall
2329880	2335480	To me that is not a Chinatown really and I think it's incumbent upon the city to
2335840	2342680	Provide affordable housing right now. There's three buildings that are affordable housing and one looks like it's on the chopping block
2343160	2348440	Because because it's such a hot area. They want to turn that into a condominium
2348640	2356640	So I don't know what the answer is basically but I think at the very least what we know we need is an infusion of capital with
2357640	2362000	Because you know, we have to put traffic in the air the area is is really a hot area now
2362080	2368480	But we need some entrepreneurs with some Chinese connections who's willing to invest in the area right now
2368480	2374640	We have we have this is like Panera Starbucks. They're all coming in but the Chinese entrepreneurs
2374640	2376640	I think are unwilling to make the investment
2377200	2382340	Okay, very good. Yeah, I think I agree with all that and you know that the one point that I did want to
2382800	2387280	Emphasize on yours that you know, we I certainly don't want it to be a commercial Chinatown
2387520	2392360	Yeah, I don't want to we don't know none of us want a Disneyland atmosphere there
2392360	2399600	We're just for tourists to come in there and gawk at the Chinese people there and that's not that's not a Chinatown
2399920	2407000	You know, we want it to be meaningful. I think what they're saying is right. We're gonna have to help help from the city planners
2407520	2413160	To bring in the right businesses and and to make the right conditions there to make it work
2414160	2418200	Excuse me, but so so we're coming to the end here
2418200	2424400	So again, I want I want to read again from from this quote here because I think it's very significant that what what what?
2424400	2430640	Bonnie Suey says in this book here says, you know, the myth of America lies in its patchwork heritage
2431400	2438080	Though the United States hasn't always tolerated difference it continues to this day to be built by immigrants
2438400	2446600	The cut this contradiction is in founding myths led to an ethnic awakening the birth of cultural pride that is still evolving
2447720	2455140	Visitors in Chinatown have a role. You all have a role just as residents do in the bartering of cultural currency
2455360	2458320	If there's authenticity to be experienced
2458720	2465640	It's that of an immigrant enclave that continues to be vital. It's a reminder of what makes America special and
2466000	2469760	And so after a century and a half of Chinese immigration
2470560	2478520	Chinatown is still the first step for new immigrants into America and for American-born Chinese into their Chinese heritage
2478880	2482080	And so I thank you all for your attention today
2482080	2488040	And I think Ted Walter and and Shirley for their participation here
2488040	2492600	And really I said you guys got a year of silence then you help us out help us with Chinatowns
2492920	2497880	You know make it make it work for us here. We're make it work for you, too. Thank you
2507920	2511680	Don't go too far away because starting in just a few minutes we'll have another
2512240	2517080	Panel discussion this one entitled young historians living histories
2517480	2522220	So starting in just a few minutes as we get set up young historians living histories
2522800	2524800	Yeah
2525080	2527080	Yeah, no
2528120	2532280	So I'd like to welcome you to day number five of the 2014
2532880	2535400	Smithsonian Folklife Festival today is
2536360	2540440	diaspora day and that's diaspora day both for the
