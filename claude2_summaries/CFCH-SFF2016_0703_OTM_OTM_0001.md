Here is a summary of the key points from this transcribed audio recording:

- This is a panel discussion on Japanese American identity held at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 2016.

- The panelists are members of the musical group FandangObon, including Nobuko Miyamoto, George Abe, Elaine Fukumoto, Nancy Sekizawa, and Sean Miura.

- They discuss when they feel most Japanese-American, often through cultural events, food, language, and being in Japanese-American communities.

- Each shares their family's experience with the Japanese American internment camps during WWII. This painful history continues to shape their identities. 

- They explain the generational impacts, from citizenship being revoked for some, to cultural loss and reclaiming traditions.

- The internment gave them understanding of the experiences of other groups who faced oppression. It influenced their activism and performing arts.

- Questions from the audience cover the justifications for internment, the atomic bombings, and visiting the former camp sites like Manzanar.

- The panelists emphasize coming to political consciousness as an ongoing process. Their stories provide context for appreciating their music.
