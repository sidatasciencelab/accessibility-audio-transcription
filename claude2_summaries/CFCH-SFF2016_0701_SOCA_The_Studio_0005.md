Here is a summary of the key points from this transcribed audio recording:

- This is an audio recording of a radio interview on Radio Biling√ºe with the musical group FandangObon at the 2016 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.

- FandangObon is a collaborative project between Chicano, Japanese, and Mexican artists that combines music and dance traditions from Son Jarocho Fandango of Veracruz, Mexico and the Obon Buddhist ceremony of Japan. 

- The interviewer speaks with members of the group including Nobuko Miyamoto, George Abe, Elaine Fukumoto, Nancy Sekizawa, and Sean Miura.

- They discuss the origins of FandangObon, merging the participatory nature of both Fandango and Obon traditions. The dance formations are similar.

- Both traditions help maintain community and culture. FandangObon allows them to reclaim Japanese-American identity and create new fusion music.

- Intergenerational learning is important to passing on traditions. The youth are interested in learning the cultural art forms.

- They hope to take FandangObon to share this cultural fusion in places like Japan, Cuba, and Veracruz. The music builds cross-cultural bridges.
