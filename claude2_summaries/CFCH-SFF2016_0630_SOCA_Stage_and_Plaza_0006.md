Here is a summary of the key points from this transcribed audio recording:

- This is a discussion about music and resilience held at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 2016.

- The participants are George Abe, a Japanese-American who was born in an internment camp during WWII, Homayoun Sakhi, an Afghan rubab player, and Salar Nader, an Afghan-American tabla player. 

- They discuss how music helped provide comfort and continuity of cultural identity during traumatic experiences like internment and being refugees. 

- George Abe explains how his family maintained artistic and musical traditions while in the camps. Music lessons actually increased.

- Homayoun Sakhi could not play openly in refugee camps in Pakistan due to Taliban rules, but practiced silently to maintain his rubab skills.

- Salar Nader teaches tabla online to a global Afghan diaspora community. Music is an outlet and source of hope for youth in Afghanistan.

- The participants demonstrate playing their instruments - shakuhachi flute, rubab, and tabla - and improvise together, showing connections across cultures.

- Key themes are music as spiritual nourishment, maintaining heritage, teaching dispersed communities, and music's power to create harmony.
